## Introduction

## Thesis
### What makes a good thesis
- WHAT + HOW (ideas + techniques/conventions)
- Use key terms from the questions
- Be as specific as possible
- Address all parts of the question
- Clear and precise
- Insightful and/or sound ideas showing understanding of the text and of the key concepts of the question
-  Engagement/Addresses the question / Focused Reading
- ­Uses EACH key word and term
- ­If question has ‘you’, then use I/my
- Uses Course Terms
- Offer a  SPECIFIC what (course concept) and how (convention and/or language)
- Clear expression - draft several versions to achieve this

> [!important] $X$ is represented/constructed as $Y$ through the use of $Z$

- The thesis has the potential to make or break hour essay

## Body Paragraphs
- How will you group or divide up your ideas? 
- Ideas
- Values and attitudes
- Characters
- Other?

### Crafting effective topic sentences
- Link clearly and directly to THESIS – USE KEY TERMS
 - WHAT & HOW
 - Be specific as you can without overcomplicating the sentence.
 - Show links to previous paragraphs (use transition words eg Similarly, In addition, However, Therefore, In contrast, Just as . . .)

### Paragraph Structure
- Teachers may use different terminology but the structure and expectations are the same.
#### Structure 1
- Topic Sentence (TS) with both WHAT and HOW
- Development sentences
	- ­Develop and support your TS to lead into your Evidence—NO NAKED QUOTATIONS
- Evidence—your short quotations from the text
- Explanation—step into word, phrase level, connotations, connections of your quotations
- Extrapolation—step further into or step out of to the course concepts

> [!note] You need to make AT LEAST two comments on each quotation/piece of evidence. The bulk of your paragraph is explanation and extrapolation (stepping in and stepping out)

#### Structure 2: TPEEPEE
- yes the name sound stupid, imagine if Michael Jackson needed to go to the bathroom, T'PEEPEE
-  Topic Sentence (as above and should of course link clearly to your thesis)
- Developing Sentence(s) if necessary – further developing the main idea in the TS
- Point 1 – 1st point supporting the idea in your TS
- Evidence (as above) for this point 1
- Explanation (as above) stepping into this evidence & how it supports your point
- Point 2 – another point supporting your TS – may build on Point 1
- Evidence for Point 2
- Explanation
- Extrapolation – step out to wider significance – link back to thesis

> [!info] Variations of these are also acceptable, but the structural elements must all be there and should work together to build a cohesive argument.

### Checking your paragraph structure
- Do you clearly and fully address the question?
- Does your topic sentence give WHAT and HOW (ideas + techniques) & link clearly to your thesis?
- Do you make points that support this?
- Do you give evidence from the text to prove these points?
- Do you explain and explore the ideas and language in these examples and possibly link back to wider concepts?
- Do you link back to your thesis, and to other paragraphs?

## Conclusion
- Restate thesis
- Summarise main points
- Final statements – extrapolate, step out to wider context, link to Course concepts

## Thesis Drafting and Essay Planning
-  Using the course concepts and syllabus, begin drafting a thesis statement.
- Consider which of the course concepts you feel most comfortable in addressing.
- Then:
- ­Begin planning and drafting topic sentences – what points will your essay be addressing?
- Find evidence to support your ideas – try explaining your evidence using the paragraph structure from before
- Complete an essay draft

*Outside of class feedback on planning/draft work will not be given the day before an assessment*
