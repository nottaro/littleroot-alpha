## Practise Essay
**Explain how Samuel Wagan Watson's application of various discourses challenges and/or promotes certain ideologies in 2 poems**


Samuel Wagan Watson challenges the post-colonial effects on the Indigenous culture, in his 2 poems, **Jaded Olympic Moments**, and **Cheap white-goods at the dreamtime sale**. More specifically, 3 ideas are promoted or challenged; The devaluation of indigenous culture, devaluation of indigenous people, and promotes the importance of land to the Indigenous Australians.

Watson challenges the devaluation of indigenous culture as an effect of post-colonialism in his poems **jaded olympic moments** and **cheap-white goods at the dreamtime sale**. In **cheap white-goods**, the title itself is highly sardonic, devaluing their culture to "cheap white-goods" at a sale. This highlights the extent (or lack thereof) to which indigenous culture is valued by the colonisers. Furthermore, in the quote, "sacred dances available out of the yellow pages", the 'sacred dances' are represented as a product, one that can be marketed. In other words, the sacred traditions and cultures of the indigenous Australians are represented in the poem as a capitalistic by-product, fit only for demonstration for the entertainment of people. Additionally, their spiritual places are referred to as "comatose totems \[littering] the landscape". This illustrates that their culture is slowly being forgotten, and also represents the oppression of their culture by colonists.
Similarly, in **jaded olympic moments**, the "capping off a sterling period of post-funeral melancholy after my young cousin’s passing" is used to highlight the disregard to indigenous customs and traditions. Traditionally, in Indigenous culture, death is an important time, and customs must be carried out carefully. To disregard this after the persona's 'cousin's passing' is considered in their culture to be the height of disrespect. Additionally, this is caused due to thievery, as can be seen in "they made their way through the sliding-door and stole the lot", which further highlights the negative effects of capitalism on the culture of Indigenous Australians. This also likens normal thievery to the colonisation of Australia, again presenting the idea that a multitude of opportunities and values were taken from the indigenous people.

Furthermore, the low extent to the negative effects of colonialism are being corrected, is challenged by Watson in his 2 poems. In **jaded olympic moments**, the title in itself suggests that the dance held at the 2012 Brisbane Olympics was nothing more than a publicity stunt. **jaded olympic moments** recounts the event when an "ochre-kissed women came out and did their thing in the center of the stadium we had tears in our eyes thinking, that’s our mob! but no, only a romantic would think that; it’s still very much an US and THEM kind of deal in this modern dreaming". "only a romantic would think that" represents that the ideal that the Olympic Committee were going for was far from what should have been done, that their efforts were "jaded", i.e. half-baked. 
Furthermore, in **cheap white-goods**, 

Finally, the importance of land to Indigenous Australians is promoted by Watson in his 2 poems. In **cheap white-goods**, the persona believes that "Uluru; a site with grandeur the neolithic additive missing from that seventh wonder of the world expo". This represents how much Uluru, a sacred site, is valued, and this is contrasted with Western Society's standard of the "Seven Wonders of the World". The persona believes, in conflict with Western beliefs, that Uluru is just as majestic and as important as the other Wonders of the World. Furthermore, the land of Australia is described as "pure soil in front of you; the dealers in Manhattan lay back and vomit". Again, this highlights the importance placed on the natural world in Aboriginal culture, and refers to Western beliefs in a sardonic tone, mocking the contempt they have for Indigenous culture, and answering that contempt with their own.
Additionally, **jaded olympic moments** also promotes this value of land. When referring to the thievery, the persona says in contrast, "if blackfellas had broken into the house; they would’ve taken Dad’s 10ft Landrights flag; ’cause it was worth just as much as Cathy Freeman’s gold". Cathy Freeman was an Aboriginal Australian who won a gold medal in the Olympics. She was a large inspiration for the Indigenous community because of this. To value a land rights flag as much as this implies that this representation of their independence, no matter the monetary cost, is worth just as much. Watson further contrasts this in "three smack-head white boys; 18, 19, 20; the gear was gone without a trace...it made sense". Again, this highlights the different values between Westerners and Indigenous Australians, that Western civilisation take the natural world for granted, and Indigenous Australians care for the land deeply, so much that it's worth as much as a gold medal.
