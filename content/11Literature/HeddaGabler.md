## Hedda Gabler - 1891 or 1890????? 
- Hedda Gabler is a Norwegian play produced by Henrik Ibsen in 1891
- Published at the height of his fame and performed across Europe
- The play dramatises the life of protagonist Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a mundane marriage and house that she views with contempt. Over the play, Hedda is forced to evaluate her life and the roles she plays - as a wife, woman and person
- Ibsen of the title of the play - "My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter than her husband's wife"
- The play critiques the marriage, society and gender norms of the time and as such provoked great controversy when premiered
- The play helped usher in the **realism** movement - focused on everyday people experiencing everyday problems. Arguably canonised as the epitome of realism and 19th century theatre
