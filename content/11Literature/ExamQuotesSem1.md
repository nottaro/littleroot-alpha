## The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde 
- Core Concept: Value of reputation 
- People will do anything to make them like them
- **Plot Summary:** Follows the story of lawyer Gabriel Utterson as he investigates Edward Hyde and his connections to his friend, Dr Henry Jekyll
- **Thesis:** Stevenson uses narrative conventions and language techniques such as symbolism, foreshadowing and allusion, and dialogue to represent the aristocracy's value of reputation. Stevenson portrays the value of reputation as one so great that people are willing to hide their personal life from their closest friends.
  
- **Uses symbolism to  the importance of the separation between one's personal and social life**
- **Uses foreshadowing and allusion to show that people's outward appearance is important, and one should not investigate it**
- **Uses dialogue to express that people will do anything to hide their alter ego**

### Foreshadowing the ending of the play:
- "I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others…” - Ensfield
	- Utterson started investigating Hyde, and uncovered secrets that lead to the death of Henry Jekyll
	- Judgement day: you are sent to heaven or hell based on your decisions, i.e. evil or good acts
		- Biblical allusion
- "I am careless...I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end." - Jekyll
	- His true personality was uncovered, and due to their value of reputation, he kills himself

### Dialogue: Expressing that people will do anything to hide their alter ego
- "I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed." - Ensfield
	- His character has been "exposed", as fearful and meek, not the sophisticated man he would like to be
- The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. "I do not care to hear more," said he. "This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop." - Jekyll
	- Jekyll's emotional side was shown, and he does not want to talk about it, for fear of exposing himself

### Symbolism: Separation between public and private life
- Use of doors is prevalent
- Symbolises the Victorian Era’s preoccupation with the separation of public life and private life
- The front door of Jekyll’s house and the back door of the laboratory, for example, represent physical barriers between the curious eyes of the public and the hidden activities inside
	- His servants are not allowed to enter
- Hyde's house door is "blistered and destained"
	- Possibly a symbol for how his attempts to hide himself have failed, e.g. the story of the door, and when he tramples an old man

## Hedda Gabler
- Core Concept: **Context influencing Main Ideas**
- Context: 19th Century Europe, the patriarchy was prevalent in most societies
- Ibsen wanted to reflect this in a negative way, and rebel against it, so to speak
- Evident in Hedda's character, in that she wants to be free
- **Thesis:** Due to the patriarchal views in the 1800s, Ibsen rejects these views and instead portrays females as strong, while also ridiculing the current patriarchal expectations of women. Ibsen uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and dialogue to provide a scathing social criticism on the patriarchal's views.
  
- Points
	- **Foreshadowing: Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms**
	- **Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek**
		- Guns
		- Chekov's gun????
	-  **Dialogue: Uses stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are**

### Conveys the idea that their current society is restricting freedoms, using foreshadowing
- Hedda is represented as someone who wants freedom
- **Hedda:** I’m content…so long as you don’t have any sort of hold over me.
	- Threatens Judge Brack as he blackmails her
	- Claims she is "no longer free"
	- Foreshadows that once she realises she is no longer free, she kills herself
- **Hedda:** I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny 
  **Mrs Elvsted:** Have you not the power?
  **Hedda:** I have not—and have never had it.
	- Foreshadows her death, as she has the power to end her destiny, so to speak

### Symbolism to reject the idea that women are meek
- Symbolism of guns
- Chekov's gun, she kills herself with the guns after being controlled
- Her connection to the guns suggests that Hedda is her father's daughter, not her husband's wife, representing independence
- **Hedda:** I’m going to shoot you sir!
	- Shows her familiarity with the guns
- **Hedda:** I’ve got one thing at least that I can pass the time with.  
  **Tesman:** Oh, thank the good Lord for that! And what might that be, Hedda? Eh?  **Hedda:** My pistols… Jörgen. 
	- Tesman is possibly condenscending, and

### Uses dialogue to provide a stereotypical representation of females in order to show how ridiculous said stereotypes are
- **Tesman:** Oh, Auntie…you’ll never stop sacrificing yourself for me!  
  **Miss Tesman:** Isn’t it the only joy I have in the world, to help you along your road, my darling boy?
- **Berte:** I’m really so scared I’ll never give satisfaction to the young mistress.  
  **Miss Tesman:** Oh, Heavens…just to begin with of course there might be this and that…  
  **Berte:** Because she’s ever so particular.
- Hedda is characterised as different, as she knows what she wants and she'll do anything to get it
- Almost manipulative
