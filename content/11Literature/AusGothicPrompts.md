> [!example]- Replaced by another
> 
> The Prime Minister never seems to last long and often disappears through no discernible democratic process. One of them eats a raw onion in an attempt to assimilate. He is gone by morning, replaced by another.

> [!example]- All of us
> 
> We all refer to the Prime Minister by their first name. We know them well, and they know us. All of us.

> [!example]- "Where the bloody hell are you?"
> 
> "Where the bloody hell are you?" The woman asks. 
> "I don't know," you weep, "I don't know."
> She asks again: "Where the bloody hell are you?" 
> She never stops asking.
 
> [!example]-  Creatures in the trees
> 
> You don't believe the stories about the creatures in the trees, but you take precautions. One day, you see an unwary traveller taking shelter from the blazing sun underneath a jacaranda. When you look back, he's gone.

> [!example]- Flood insurance
>
 The sun is broiling the land dry. Half the country is on fire. You look up at the sky and worry about your flood insurance.![](images/FloodInsurance.png)

> [!example]- Swooping season 
> 
> You are swooped by a magpie in the same place, at the same time, every single day. 
> "It's swooping season!" Says your neighbour. 
> It has always been swooping season.

> [!example]- Whisked away by submarines
>
 The Prime Minister walks into the ocean and is never seen again. They say he was a traitor, defecting to the enemy, whisked away by submarines. You build a swimming pool in his honour.
