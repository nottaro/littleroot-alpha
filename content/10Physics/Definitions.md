**Decay:** occurs when unstable nuclei breakdown into smaller parts, sitting small particles with high energy

**Radioactive decay:** process in which unstable nuclei break down into smaller particles

**Ionising ability:** ease which radioactivity forms ions

**Penetrating power:** extent of different types of radiation to pass through matter 

**Mass defect:** difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole 

-   The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons

**Nuclear energy:** binding energy that is released when a nucleon is removed from its nucleus

**Strong nuclear force:** force that holds neutrons and protons(nucleus) together, and stops the nucleus from breaking apart from the repulsion caused by electrostatic forces between protons

**Electrostatic forces:** force between stationary charges. Opposites attract, same charges repel

**Proton:** positively charged particle in nucleus

**Neutron:** neutrally charged particle in nucleus

**Electron:** negatively charged particle orbiting nucleus

**Proton number:** number of protons in nucleus

**Nucleon:** Protons and neutrons

**Nucleon number:** number of nucleons in nucleus

**Isotope:** variations of the same element with different amounts of neutrons

**Radiation:** emission of energy in electromagnetic waves or subatomic particles, usually fast-moving ones

**Background radiation:** level of ionising radiation in environment

**Natural sources of radiation:** radiation that is emitted naturally by the environment

**Artificial sources of radiation:** radiation that is emitted artificially, or is made to emit it, e.g. x-rays, smoking (radionuclides in tobacco smoke)

**Radioactivity:** property exhibited by certain substances of emitting energy and subatomic particles spontaneously

**Alpha particle:** 2 neutrons and 2 protons ejected from a heavier nucleus to make it lighter. Identical to a helium nucleus

**Beta particle:** negatively charged particle with little to no mass is ejected from a nucleus with an excess of neutrons (neutron converts into proton). Identical to an electron

**Gamma particle/ray:** electromagnetic radiation with a high frequency and shortest wavelength, discharged from nucleus with an excess of energy. Light.

$e=mc^2$: energy and mass equation, used to find the mass defect and binding energy of an atom. Interrelates energy and mass. Einstein’s equation, mass-energy equivalence
-   Proves that mass can be converted into energy, allowing smf to be applied

**Mass defect:** difference between the mass of the nucleus and the combined mass of the nucleons

**Binding energy:** the mass defect is converted into energy with e=mc2, and is used to hold the nucleus together. This is considered binding energy

**Half-life:** the time it takes for half of a radioisotope/radioactive substance to decay

**Fission:** a process in which a heavier nucleus splits into 2 lighter nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process

**Fusion:** a process in which 2 lighter nuclei combine into 1 heavier nucleus, releasing a huge amount of energy in the process

**Atomic Mass unit (AMU)**: Mass of an atom relative to 1/12 of the mass of a free-floating carbon atom

**Atomic Mass:** Mass of an atom, measured in AMU
