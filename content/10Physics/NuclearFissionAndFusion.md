[go back](10Subjects/10Physics.md)

## **Nuclear Fission**
-   Nucleus of an atom is bombarded with neutrons to split the heavier nucleus into smaller and lighter nuclei
-   This makes the nucleus so unstable that it splits into 2
-   A lot of energy is released
-   Occur artificially
-   Little energy is required to split an atom
-   Atomic bomb is based on concept of nuclear fission
-   Often involves releases of gamma rays and free neutrons

## **Nuclear Fusion**
-   2 or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus
-   An enormous amount of energy is released, much larger than nuclear fission
-   Occurs in stars and the sun
-   Huge amount of energy is required to bring 2 atoms together
-   Therefore, happens in very, very hot conditions
-   Cold fusion is a concept that entails nuclear fusion happening at room temperature
-   Hydrogen bomb is based on concept of nuclear fusion
-   Usually releases neutrons or protons as well as new nucleus![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%203.46.43%20pm.png)![](images/Fission%20&%20Fusion.png)
- Strong magnetic field is required for magnetic confinement
- Ensures plasma doesn’t escape
- Confinement ensures that fusion occurs, and makes it safe

## **Mass defect**
-   The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons
-   Mass defect: difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole 
-   The difference in mass is considered to be the **binding energy** of the nucleus
-   We can calculate the energy through $e=mc^2$
-   e = energy in J
-   m = mass in kg
-   c = speed of light, or 300 000 000 m/s

## **Binding Energy**
-   The difference in mass (mass defect) is considered to be binding energy
-   If the mass of 4He was equal to the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons, the nucleus would fall apart without any input of energy
-   To be stable, its mass must be less than that of its constituents combined 
-   The nuclear binding energy represents the amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus to break it apart into its individual nucleons

## **Nuclear Energy**
1.  Element is bombarded with neutrons
2.  Neutrons are absorbed
3.  Nucleus becomes unstable and splits into smaller nuclei, radioactive energy and lone neutrons
