## Nuclear Power Stations

### **Pros**
-   Energy efficient
-   Small land footprint
-   Average nuclear power plant producing 2000 MW takes up a square mile of space
-   Very powerful, energy wise
-   Reliable
-   Produce their maximum power output 93% of the time
-   Very stable
-   Produces no greenhouse gases
### **Cons**
-   Closely connected to nuclear weapon technology production/proliferation
-   Dangerous to society
-   Nuclear waste
-   Extremely poisonous products
-   Takes 10s of 1000s of years to stop being radioactive/poisonous
-   Possibility of nuclear accidents
-   Uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions
-   Neutrons from fission reaction create another fission reaction
-   Causes excess of energy in the form of heat
-   Sometimes the heat is too much for the reactor to handle
-   It melts, and radioactive waste is expelled
-   Expensive to set up
-   Uranium is expensive

### **Nuclear Power Station Components**
-   Fuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium
-   Moderator: material that slows down neutrons
	-   Graphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide
	-   Heavy water is the best but is too expensive
	-   Water with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen
	-   Graphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen
	-   Ensures that neutron capture occurs
	-   When the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy
-   Control rods: material that absorbs neutrons
	-   Boron steel or cadmium
	-   Ensures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission
-   Coolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down
	-   e.g. water
-   Radiation shield: thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%208.00.46%20pm.png)

## **Uses of Radiation**
### **Medical Tracers**
-   Radioactive substance injected into the body
-   Usually iodine, as it is absorbed by the thyroid gland
-   They measure the gamma radiation emitted to track pathways or image the body
-   Gamma is used as it is very penetrative (easier to measure from surface), and is less deadly in equal amounts (from the inside) than alpha and beta
### **Industrial Tracers**
-   Radioactive substance used in factories/industrial use
-   Much the same concept as a medical tracer
-   Injected into the system
-   Finds leaks in systems, or tracks certain chemicals
-   You can use a radioactive tracer if any escapes
### **X-Rays**
-   Electromagnetic waves are directed at the area of concern
-   A material is placed behind the area
-   The x-ray penetrates your body and into the area
-   They image the shadows in the area to find out what’s wrong
-   The bones absorb the x-ray, making this very useful, as we can see shadows, of the bone, or we can observe the brighter sections to view the muscles
### **Radiometric/Carbon Dating**
-   Radioactive dating uses the known half-life of an isotope and its composition to determine the age of a specimen
-   The most common is carbon dating, but that’s only good for 40-50000 years
-   When an archeological specimen is created in its time, it will mostly be carbon 14, but will slowly, over thousands of years, decay into nitrogen 14
-   By measuring how much nitrogen/carbon 14 is present, we can very accurately determine the age of the specimen by comparing it to the carbon-12 levels of living things
-   Carbon has a half life of 5730 years
-   Since it’s only good for 40-50000 years, it’s good for measuring the age of human artefacts and similar things, but useless for determining things in the millions, e.g. dinosaur fossils, ancient rock formations
-   For this, we use the decay of uranium into lead, which takes around 4.5 billion years
-   By measuring how much lead is present, we can also determine the age of this specimen![](images/Contamination.png)
