- Waves: The transfer of energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter
	- I.e. after energy is transferred, there is no displacement of matter
- Mechanical waves: transfer energy from one place to another without the net displacement of matter, but requires a medium to propagate
	- The particles in the medium vibrate back and forth about fixed positions (equilibrium position)
- Transverse waves: particles vibrate perpendicular to the direction of energy flow, e.g. water, electromagnetic waves
- Longitudinal waves: particles vibrate along straight lines parallel to the direction of the energy flow

- However:
	1. Assumes no other disturbances in the motion
	2. Ignores situations where there is no medium
- Requirements for medium:
	1. Mechanical waves must have a medium, e.g. sound
	2. Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium, e.g. EMR

## Anatomy of a Wave

- Crest: Highest displacement of a particle in the positive direction
	- Highest point in the graph
- Trough: Lowest displacement of a particle in the negative direction
	- Lowest point in the graph
- Wavelength ($\lambda$): Distance between any 2 consecutive points in a wave that are in phase
	- From one crest to another crest
	- From one trough to another trough
	- Distance it takes for the wave to repeat
- Frequency (f): The number of complete oscillations per second. Unit of frequency is the Hz(Hertz)
	- Remains constant, even if reflected/refracted
	- Frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to one another
- Period (T): Time take for one wavelength to complete (seconds), equal to $$\frac{1}{f}$$
- Phase: State of vibration that a particle has reached in its cycle of motion. Waves are in phase when particles of the wave move in the exact same way at the same time
- Speed = distance/time
- Distance = speed $\times$ time
- Time = distance/speed
$$v=f{\lambda}=\frac{\lambda}{T}$$
- Speed of sound at $25˚ C$ is $346$ $ms^{-1}$
- $f$ remains constant, thus if $v$ increases, $\lambda$ increases
## Wave Behaviours
- Energy incident upon a surface is
	- Reflected
	- Absorbed
	- Transmitted (goes through the object)
	- Usually a combination of these 3

## Reflection
### Reflection
- When energy is incident upon a surface (e.g. boundary between 2 different mediums), then some/all of the energy "bounces" back into the original medium
### Law of Reflection
- The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence
- Angle of incidence: angle between the incident ray and the normal

## Refraction
- Occurs when a wave passes from the medium to another, at an angle other than 90˚ and changes direction
- Changes speed, and therefore wavelength, but not frequency
- NB: The media may simply be referred to as slow(er) or fast(er)
- We all know that in order of density, solid > liquid > air > vacuum
	- Sound: speed of sound increases with density of medium
	- Light: speed of light decreases with density of medium
		- If a ray goes into a slower medium it bends towards the normal

## Diffraction
- Bending/spreading of waves beyond a gap/slit/aperture with no change in wavelength, frequency or velocity
- **Diffraction around corners**
	- When a wave moves past a corner, due to the wavefront being a source of secondary wavelets; the wave diffracts and spreads out. 
	- The area where there is no diffraction is called the shadow region

- **Wavelength Effect**
	- Diffraction increases with increase in wavelength. 
	- Thus long wavelength (low frequency) waves are diffracted more than short wavelength (high frequency) waves
	- This is why ultrasound waves don’t diffract much and are used for locating purposes such as in sonar or ultrasound; they do not disperse/diffract much at all.

- **Aperture Size Effect** 
	- As the aperture size increases, the extent of diffraction decreases. 
	- As the aperture Size decreases, the extent of diffraction increases 
	- The diffraction is greater when wavelength size is roughly equal to the aperture size
	- For apertures smaller than the wavelength size, there is no diffraction
