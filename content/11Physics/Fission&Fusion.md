## **Nuclear Fission**
-   Nucleus of an atom is bombarded with neutrons to split the heavier nucleus into smaller and lighter nuclei
-   This makes the nucleus so unstable that it splits into 2
-   A lot of energy is released
-   Occur artificially
-   Little energy is required to split an atom
-   Atomic bomb is based on concept of nuclear fission
-   Often involves releases of gamma rays and free neutrons

## **Nuclear Fusion**
-   2 or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus
-   An enormous amount of energy is released, much larger than nuclear fission
-   Occurs in stars and the sun
-   Huge amount of energy is required to bring 2 atoms together
-   Therefore, happens in very, very hot conditions
-   Cold fusion is a concept that entails nuclear fusion happening at room temperature
-   Hydrogen bomb is based on concept of nuclear fusion
-   Usually releases neutrons or protons as well as new nucleus

- Strong magnetic field is required for magnetic confinement
- Ensures plasma doesnâ€™t escape
- Confinement ensures that fusion occurs, and makes it safe
