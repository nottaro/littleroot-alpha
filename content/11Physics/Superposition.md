[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)

- Superposition occurs when 2 waves travelling in the same medium meet
- Their amplitudes combine algebraically to produce a resultant wave **at that particular instant**
- When the 2 waves superimpose, the resultant displacement of the particles is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual displacements of the original waves

## Constructive Interference
- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **in phase** interfere/superimpose
- Resultant wave has an amplitude greater than each of the individual waves
- Equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves

### Application: Amplified Speakers
- When 2 speakers are made to produce the same sound, the sound waves produced interfere with each other
- Thus, at certain places (anti-nodes), constructive interference occurs, and the sound is louder (amplitude increases)
- At nodes, destructive interference occurs, and the sound is quieter (amplitude decreases)

## Destructive Interference
- 2 waves of equal frequency that are **not in phase** meet and superimpose, crating a resultant wave that has amplitude lower than each of the individual waves
- Here the individual waves have positive and negative amplitudes, and so they combine to produce a wave of smaller amplitude
- **Complete Destructive Interference**
	- 2 waves of equal frequency that are completely **not in phase**, i.e. 180˚ out of phase, combine
	- Negative amplitude of one wave, and the positive amplitude of other combine to completely cancel out at the instant when they meet

### Application: Noise Cancelling Headphones
- Incoming sound waves have specific waveforms
- External microphones detect this ambient sound and invert the waveform
- As the ambient sound and inverted sound are 180˚ **out of phase**, complete destructive interference occurs, and thus the listener hears nothing
- The inverted sound is such that it does not combine with the music sound wave, thus listeners can still hear their music

## Standing Waves
- Resultant wave that forms when 2 waves of **equal frequency** and **amplitude** that are **moving in the opposite direction** meet
- No net transfer of energy
- Wave does not travel in any direction
- **Nodes**: In a standing wave, there are moments when the 2 identical waves travelling in opposite directions are 180˚ out of phase; here a complete destructive interference occurs, and there is no particle displacement
- **Anti-nodes**: There are also moments when 2 identical waves are in phase and so complete constructive interference occurs and there is maximum particle displacement; here the particles vibrate about the equilibrium position but do not propagate in any direction
