[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)

## **Mass defect**
-   The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the combined masses of the nucleons
-   Mass defect: difference between total mass of the individual nucleons, and the mass of the nucleus as a whole 
-   The difference in mass is considered to be the **binding energy** of the nucleus
## **Binding Energy**
-   The difference in mass (mass defect) is considered to be binding energy
-   If the mass of 4He was equal to the mass of 2 protons + 2 neutrons, the nucleus would fall apart without any input of energy
-   To be stable, its mass must be less than that of its constituents combined 
-   The nuclear binding energy represents the amount of energy that must be put into a nucleus to break it apart into its individual nucleons

## Equations
### SI units
-   We can calculate the energy through $e=mc^2$
-   e = energy in J
-   m = mass in kg
-   c = speed of light, or 300 000 000 m/s

### Other units
- Sometimes, you'll be given units in amu
- In this case, find the mass of all nucleons, and subtract the mass of the nucleus from that
- You should get a value in amu
- Multiply this by 931, and this will be the binding energy in MeV
- This can be converted into Joules using the data sheet formulas
- In short: $MeV = 931\times amu$
