**************Accuracy:****************** How close your experimentally derived number is to the “true” or “real” quantity being measured

**Precision:** How the repeat values or a given trial are to each other, ***OR*** the fineness of the scale on the instrument being used to take measurements

**Reliability:** If we conduct more trials and find that the results we get each time are not significantly different from the others

**Validity:** No other variables, known or unknown, are impacting the independent or dependent variables (fair tests)

# Uncertainty/Error

********Measurement uncertainty:******** uncertainty which is a property of the measuring instrument

-   Unavoidable, quantifiable, hopefully very small

********Systematic Error:******** Impacts each trial in the same direction away from the true value

-   Bias in direction

**************************Random Error:************************** Impacts each trial but with no bias in direction, and if truly random, should cancel out with respect to accuracy

************************Absolute uncertainty(AU):************************

-   A.k.a. Measurement Uncertainty
-   A fundamental property of any measuring instrument
-   Equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ the smallest increment of scale
    -   E.g., 30 cm ruler with 1 mm increments, AU is ± 0.005 cm

**Relative/Percentage Uncertainty(%U)**

-   A property of the measurement taken

$$ \frac{AU}{measurement}\times100\% $$

## Rules for Calculating Error in compound measurements

1.  If multiplying or dividing, add %U together
2.  If adding or subtracting, add AU together
