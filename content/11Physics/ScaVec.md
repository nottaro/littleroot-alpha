# Scalars

-   Value only with magnitude
-   Distance (s), in **m**
-   Speed (|v| or v), in $ms^{-1}$
-   Time (t), in s

$$ |v| = \frac{s}{t} $$

$$ s = t\times|v| $$

$$ t=\frac{s}{|v|} $$

# Vectors

-   Value that require direction and magnitude to be fully described
-   If they don't give you a direction, say "in the direction the body is travelling"
-   Displacement (s) in **m**
-   Velocity (v), in $ms^{-1}$
-   Acceleration (a), in $ms^{-2}$
-   Force (F), in $N$

$$ v = \frac{s}{t} $$

$$ s = tv $$

$$ t=\frac{s}{v} $$

$$ F=ma $$

$$ Work=Fs $$

## Vector Diagrams

-   Vectors can be represented in a diagram
-   Arrows are used to represent vector quantities
-   Must be some vector on each side
-   Must be resolved

### Adding Vectors

******************************************For 2 Vectors A and B******************************************

![](images/vec.png)

We can use the triangle method:
![](images/tri.png)


and use the Cosine Rule to find the magnitude of side c:

$$ c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\times cos(C) $$

and the Sine rule to find the angle it makes from the x axis. They’ll usually give you another angle, to add to this value, as this is not connected to the x or y axis.

$$ \frac {sin(A)}{a}=\frac {sin(B)}{b}=\frac {sin(C)}{c} $$

where the capital letter is the angle opposite the lower-case letter
- E.g., angle **A** is opposite side **a**. 
This also works for the reciprocals of this equation.


We can also use the ******parallelogram method,****** and use the methods described above

There’s also adding vector components, but that’s a bit complicated, and we don’t need to know that at this point in time.
