## Vibrations
- Vibration: Mechanical phenomenon where oscillation occurs around an equilibrium point
- Free Vibration: When a force is applied to any object, then that object is allowed to vibrate at its natural frequency
- Forced Vibration: When a force is applied to an object and it is forced to vibrate at a particular frequency
- Natural frequency: frequency at which an object vibrates when it is not disturbed by an outside force

## Resonance
- Resonance: Phenomenon that occurs where an object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency
- Energy is transferred from the forced oscillator to the receiver with maximum efficiency, and the amplitude of the vibration is increased greatly

## Modes of Vibration
- The different ways in which a system vibrates naturally/oscillates
- The frequency of oscillation is termed as modal frequency. The shape made by the system is called mode shape/harmonic pattern
- The modes of vibration and the different harmonic frequencies depend on the physical nature and dimensions of the system; aka **boundary conditions**
- **Fundamental Frequency**: The lowest frequency at which a system will resonate is called the fundamental frequency. Here, the system vibrates in its 1st mode
- **Harmonic**: Positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency of a system
- **Overtones**: allowed resonant modes of vibration above the fundamental mode of vibration
- **Nodes**: In a standing wave, there are moments when the 2 identical waves travelling in opposite directions are 180Ëš out of phase; here a complete destructive interference occurs, and there is no particle displacement
- **Anti-nodes**: There are also moments when 2 identical waves are in phase and so complete constructive interference occurs and there is maximum particle displacement; here the particles vibrate about the equilibrium position but do not propagate in any direction

## Closed Pipes
- One end is open and one end is closed
