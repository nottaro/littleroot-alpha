- Wave that travels through the Earth or a planetary body
- The propagation velocity of a seismic wave depends on density and elasticity of the medium as well as the type of wave. 
	- Velocity tends to increase with depth through Earth's crust and mantle, but drops sharply going from the mantle to Earth's outer core
- Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth.
- Surface waves travel across the surface. Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves which travel in three dimensions.
- Amplitude of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.
- Different travel times of seismic waves are used to locate their epicentre
- Refraction or reflection of seismic waves is used for research into Earth's internal structure
- Scientists sometimes generate and measure vibrations to investigate shallow, subsurface structures.
- Compressional waves: Seismic, longitudinal body waves
- Shear waves: Seismic, transverse body waves

### P-Waves 
- Primary waves (P-waves) are compressional waves that are longitudinal in nature. 
- P-waves are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through the earth to arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name "Primary". 
- These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel nearly 1.7 times faster than the S-waves. 
- In air, they take the form of sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound

### S-Waves
- Secondary waves (S-waves) are shear waves that are transverse in nature. 
- Following an earthquake event, S-waves arrive at seismograph stations after the faster-moving P-waves and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
- Depending on the propagational direction, the wave can take on different surface characteristics; for example, in the case of horizontally polarized S waves, the ground moves alternately to one side and then the other. S-waves can travel only through solids, as fluids (liquids and gases) do not support shear stresses. 
- S-waves are slower than P-waves, and speeds are typically around 60% of that of P-waves in any given material. 
- Shear waves can't travel through any liquid medium, so the absence of S-waves in earth's outer core suggests a liquid state.
