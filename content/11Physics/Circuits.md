- Consists of converting electrical potential energy into other useful types of energy
- 3 parts to a circuit (minimum)
	1. Source of potential energy
		1. Battery
		2. Electrical cells
		3. Power points
	2. Wires
	3. Device/Component/Resistor

- Current: conventional current, i.e. flow of positive charge
- Electron current refers to flow of electrons

## Circuit Diagrams
 ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020230801092559.png)
 - Ammeter: measures current (I), unit ampere (A)
 - Voltmeter: measures potential difference (pd)
	 - Voltage (V)
	 - e.m.f., electromotive force
	 - Measured in volts (V)
- Galvanometer: a very sensitive ammeter

## Why do electrons move in a circuit?
- Electrical potential energy: results from a separation of charge, i.e. potential difference i.e. voltage i.e. e.m.f.
- $$V=\frac{W}{q}$$
- V = voltage/pd/emf measured in volts (V)
- W = ($\Delta E$) = work done on charges (J)
- q = charge (C)

### Current
- Current: rate of flow of charge, a.k.a. flow of electrons
$$I=\frac{q}{\Delta t}$$
- I = current in amperes (A)
- q = charge (C)
- t = time elapsed (s)

## Series Circuits
- When components in a circuit are connected in the same path, they are said t be in **series**
- When components are connected in different branches of a circuit, they are said to be in **parallel**
- Ammeters must be connected in series
- Voltmeters must be connected in parallel

## Things we should have noticed in practical

### Series
- For a single component in series with emf, current was the same in every part of the circuit
- If more components are added in series, the current is the same in every part of the circuit, but less than before
	- $I_{total}=I_1=I_2=I_3...$
- The voltage for a single component, V ~ emf
- If more components are added, their individual Voltage < emf (decreases), but sum of voltage = total voltage
	- $V_{total}=V_1+V_2+V_3...$

### Parallel
- For components in parallel, the current is divided between them
	- $I_{total}=I_1+I_2+I_3...$
- Voltage is the same in each branch
	- $V_{total}=V_1=V_2=V_3...$

## Ohm's Law
- **Resistance**: measure of the difficulty with which charge flows in a medium
- $V=IR$
	- V: voltage (in volts)
	- I: current (in amps)
	- R: resistance (in ohms)

### Resistance in a series component:
- $V=IR_{total}=IR_1+IR_2+IR_3...$
- $R_{total}=R_1+R_2+R_3...$
- $V_k=IR_k$ 


### Resistance in a parallel component
- $V_{total}=V_1=V_2=V_3...$
- $I=\frac{V}{R_{total}}=\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}+\frac{V}{R_3}...$
- $\frac{1}{R_{total}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}...$
