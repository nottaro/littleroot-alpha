- Fuse: excess current will melt wire, break circuit and prevent house fire, but not death by electrocution
- Residual circuit devices (rcd): monitors for any difference in current between active and neutral wires, and if difference is detected then circuit is cut (tripped) in nano-seconds
	- Thus saves houses and lives
- Electrocution: harm caused by an electrical current
