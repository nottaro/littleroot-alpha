[go back](11Subjects/11Physics.md)

- The time it takes for $1/2$ of a sample of a given radionuclide to undergo decay
- Ways of measuring
	- Number of nuclides (nuclides/time)
	- Mass of radioisotopes

$$N_1=N_0 \times (\frac{1}{2})^x$$
- where x is the number of half lives it has undergone, and $N_1$ and $N_0$ are the final and original amounts of the substance, respectively


Number of half lives that have been undergone:

$$\frac{\log(\frac{N_1}{N_0})}{\log{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
Number of years that have passed

$$\frac{\log(\frac{N_1}{N_0})}{\log{\frac{1}{2}}}\times half\ life$$
