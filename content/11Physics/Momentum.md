## Momentum

Momentum: Mass (kg) x Velocity (m/s) , units are $kg$ $ms^{-1}$

-   Vector quantity, include direction

$$ p = mv $$

****************************Rate of Change****************************

-   The rate of change of momentum of an object is equal to the force applied to the object

$$ \frac{\Delta{p}}{t} = \frac{p_f-p_i}{t} $$

$$ =\frac{m(v-u)}{t} $$

$$ =(\frac{v-u}{t})m $$

$$ =ma=F $$

**Momentum is conserved**

-   **Law of Conservation of Mass**: mass is not created nor destroyed, only combined with mass/energy
-   **Law of Conservation of Energy**: energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed or transferred

******************************************************Momentum cannot be created nor destroyed******************************************************

**âˆ´** Total momentum before an event = Total momentum after an event

$$ m_1u_1+m_2u_2=m_1v_1+m_2v_2 $$

## Impulse

-   Change in momentum
    -   Include direction
-   Product of force and time
-   $N\times{s}$, or $Newtons \times seconds$
- Can also be written as $kg$ $ms^{-1}$

$$ j =Ft $$

$$ j=\Delta{p} = m(v-u) $$
