- The equation for a straight line is $$y=mx+c$$
- y and x are values on the graph
- c is the y intercept
- m is the gradient, which affects the slope of the curve
- The larger the gradient, the sharper the slope
$$m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$

- For **perpendicular lines**, the product of the 2 gradients = -1
	- i.e., the gradients are the negative reciprocals of each other
- For **parallel** lines, the gradients are identical to each other

- To find where 2 lines intersect, equate the equations, i.e.: $$m_1x+c_1=m_2x+c_2$$
- The midpoint of 2 points is calculated as such $$\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}$$
- The distance between 2 points is calculated as such $$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)+(y_2-y_1))}$$


- That's all I had to know for Year 11, your curriculum may be different
