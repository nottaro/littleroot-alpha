## Index Laws
$$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$$
$$a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$$
$$a^0 = 1$$
$$a^{-m}= \frac{1}{a^m}$$
$$(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$$
$$(ab)^n=a^n b^n$$
$$(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$$

## Rational Indices
$$a^\frac{m}{n}=\  ^n\sqrt{a^m}$$
$$(a^{\frac{1}{n}})^n = a$$
- In the previous sub-topic, we stated the index laws for $m$ and $n$ integers
- These laws are applicable for all rational indices

## Standard form and scientific notation
- The number is expressed as a product of:
	- A number between 1 and 10
	- A power of 10


## Graphs of exponential functions
$$b \times a^{cx} +d$$
- y intercept is at $d+1$
- b is dilation parallel to y axis
- $\frac{1}{c}$ is the dilation parallel to the x axis
- It never actually reaches 0 (forms an asymptote at y=0)

$$(\frac{1}{z})^x = z^{-x}$$

## Solving Exponential Equations and Inequalities
- You literally just use mental math
- Teacher really went "just get good"
- ok uh
- if $a^x = a^y$, it is assumed that $x=y$
- One method for solving an exponential equation, without using a calculator, is first to express both sides of the equation as powers with the same base and then to equate the indices
### The actual way
- you use logarithmic functions
- If $a^x = y$
$$x=\frac{log(y)}{log(a)}$$

## Exponential Models and Applications
- In the following, we consider a variable $A$ that is subjective to exponential change
- Let $A$ be the quantity at time $t$
- Thus, $A=A_0 b^t$, where $A_0$ is the initial quantity and $b$ is a positive constant
