-   Value with Direction and Magnitude

## Vector Diagrams

-   Vectors can be represented in a diagram
-   Arrows are used to represent vector quantities
-   Must be some vector on each side
-   Must be resolved

### Adding Vectors

**For 2 Vectors A and B**

![](images/vec.png)

We can use the triangle method:
![](images/tri.png)


and use the Cosine Rule to find the magnitude of side c:

$$ c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\times cos(C) $$

and the Sine rule to find the angle it makes from the x axis. They’ll usually give you another angle, to add to this value, as this is not connected to the x or y axis.

$$ \frac {sin(A)}{a}=\frac {sin(B)}{b}=\frac {sin(C)}{c} $$

where the capital letter is the angle opposite the lower-case letter
- E.g., angle **A** is opposite side **a**. 
This also works for the reciprocals of this equation.


We can also use the ******parallelogram method,****** and use the methods described above

There's also adding Vector Components, but I'll cover that later

## Vectors in Euclidean Geometry

-   Line segments are geometrical objects
    
-   $AB$ is the magnitude
   
-   $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector
    
-   $\overline{AB}$ is a line segment
    
-   ABCD is a parallelogram
    
 ![](images/para%202.png)
    
-   $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ are different line segments because, on the cartesian plane, their coordinates are different
    
    -   $\therefore \overline{AD}≠\overline{BC}$
-   $\overrightarrow{AD}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$ are the same vector, as they have the same magnitude and direction
    
    -   $\therefore \overrightarrow{AD}=\overrightarrow{BC}$
-   Vectors don’t have a fixed location!
    
-   Think of vectors as properties of (directed) line segments
    
-   Addition of vectors in geometry:
    

$$ \overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}+\overrightarrow{CD}+\overrightarrow{DE}+\overrightarrow{EF}=\overrightarrow{AF} $$

## Abstract Vectors

-   Vectors can be represented abstractly as mathematical objects which obey certain rules
-   They can be notated as lowercase letters in bold
    -   **a**
-   Or underlined
    -   $\underline{a}$

### Mathematical Rules for Abstract Vectors

****************Equality****************

-   2 vectors are equal if and only if their magnitudes are equal and their directions are equal
-   Same magnitude, same direction are “like” vectors
-   Same magnitude, different directions are “unlike” vectors
-   Same direction, different magnitude are “like” vectors
-   2 vectors that are parallel, but in opposite directions, are “unlike” vectors

******************The Negative of a Vector******************

-   For a vector **a**, the vector **-a** has the same magnitude but an opposiute direction

$$ -\overrightarrow{AB}=\overrightarrow{BA} $$

**Scalar Multiplication**

-   Given a vector $a$, $2a=a+a$
-   For a vector **a**, and positive scalar $k$(i.e., a positive real number), the vector k**a** is the vector with the same direction as **a** and magnitude k|**a**|
-   For a negative $k$,$ka=k|-a|$

**********Subtracting Vectors**********

-   Think of **$a-b=a+(-b)$**

$$ \overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}-\overrightarrow{DC}=\overrightarrow{AD} $$

************The Zero Vector************

-   The zero vector **$0$** has magnitude 0 and an ******************undefined****************** direction

## Vectors in Component Form

-   Any 2D vector can be resolved into a sum of horizontal and verticale components, written as $$a\underline{i}+b\underline{j}$$ where **i** and **j** are unit vectors
-   Vectors in component form can be added by adding their components and simplifying
![](images/vector%201.png)
-   A vector ****v**** can be written in component form as
![](images/vector%202.png)
-   Given a vector $\underline{v}=a\underline{i}+b\underline{j}$:
- $|\underline{v}|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ -
- $tan\ \theta=\frac{b}{a}$ 
- Your calculator will evaluate this with an angle between $-90˚$and $90˚$
-  This may not match the quadrant of the vector! If not, add $180˚$ 
-  If the vector is in the 4th quadrant, your calculator will give a negative angle. Add $360˚$to get the equivalent positive angle

## Unit Vectors
-   Vector that is the same as another with a magnitude of 1
-   $\frac{1}{|\underline{v}|}\underline{v}$

## Vector Equations
- Vector questions can involve setting up equations and solving them
- Remember, 2 vectors are only equal if their magnitude and direction are equal
- Equivalently, 2 vectors in component form are equal if and only if their components are equal
- $ai+bj=ci+dj$ if and only if $a=c$ and $b=d$
- This means that solving equations with vectors in component form usually incolve equating components

## Position Vectors
-   Vector used to represent the position of a point relative to the origin (in the Cartesian plane when working in a 2D space)

$$ \overrightarrow{AB}=-\overrightarrow{OA}+\overrightarrow{OB} $$

## Multiplication of Vectors

-   There are various different ways you could define the product of 2 vectors
-   The scalar/dot product of 2 vectors ***a** and **b** is
$$ a\cdot b=b\cdot a=|a||b| cos(\theta) $$
-   $\theta$ is the angle between vectors arranged tail to tail or nose to nose

$$ a \cdot a=|a|^2 $$
$$ a\cdot (\lambda b)=\lambda a \cdot b $$
$$ a \cdot (b+c)=a \cdot b+a\cdot c $$
$$(^a_b) \cdot (^c_d)=(^{ac}_{bd})$$
-   $a \perp b$ if and only if $a \times b = 0$

## Geometric Proofs using Vectors
- Facts of vector algebra you can use:
	- **a** = **b** if and only if **a** and **b** have the same magnitude and direction
	- -**a** has the same magnitude as **a** but the opposite direction
	- For a scalar $\lambda >0$, $\lambda \overrightarrow{a}$ has magnitude $\lambda |a|$ and the same direction as a
	- If $a=\lambda b$, then if $\lambda >0$ , **a** and **b** are like parallel vectors; otherwise, if $\lambda < 0$, **a** and **b** are unlike vectors
	- Vectors can be added with a triangle of vectors
	- $a-b=a+(-b)$ 
	- If $\lambda$ is a scalar, then $\lambda(a+b)=\lambda{a}+\lambda{b}$
	- $a \perp b$ if and only if $a \times b = 0$
 
## Relative Vectors
- For this, we use the concept of position vectors
- The position of Vector A relative to Vector B = $\overrightarrow{A}-\overrightarrow{B}$
- The velocity of Vector A relative to Vector B = $-\overrightarrow{A}+\overrightarrow{B}$
