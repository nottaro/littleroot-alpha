## "For all" statements
- Sometimes in proofs, we get "for all statements"
- An example would be, "for all integers n,  n to the power of 3, take n, is divisible by 3"
- This would be written as: $n^3 - n = 3k, k \in \mathbb{Z^+}, \forall \ n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$
- So...how do we solve this?
- There are infinite numbers, thus we can't prove that all of them are subjective to this proof by trial and error
- Instead, we must use proof by induction

## How to do a proof by induction
1. Prove that the statement is true for n=1
2. Assume the statement is true, for some integer k
3. Prove that the statement is true for k+1
4. Say, "By the principle of mathematical induction, it can thus be concluded that \[proof] is true"
