### Content you are assumed to know (from Methods)
- Angles in degrees in radians (and converting between units)
- Defining sin  and cos using the unit circle
- Graphs of y = sin x, y = cos x, and y = tan x
- The Pythagorean Identity
	- $sin^2 (x) + cos^2 (x) =1$
- Symmetry properties of trig functions
	- $sin (\theta) = sin (\pi - \theta)$
- Exact values of trig functions for integer multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$ radians

## Basic Trig Functions
$$sin(-\theta)=-sin(\theta)$$
$$cos (-\theta)=cos(\theta)$$
$$tan(-\theta)=-tan(\theta)$$
$$sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{2})=cos(\theta)$$
$$cos(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2})=sin(\theta)$$
## General solutions to trig equations
- Remember that a trig equation such as $cos(\theta) = 0.3$ has infinitely many solutions
	- There are 2 solutions even in one revolution of the unit circle
	- However, a scientific calculator, if asked to evaluate $cos^{-1}(0.3)$ will only give one value
	- How does it decide which value to give?
- Inverse trig functions
	- By convention: $cos^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | 0 ≤ \theta ≤ \pi \}$
	- By convention: $sin^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | -\frac{π}{2} ≤ \theta ≤ \frac{π}{2}  \}$
	- By convention: $tan^{-1}$ has range $\{ \theta | -\frac{π}{2} < \theta < \frac{π}{2}  \}$
