## Things you are assumed to know already
- Angle sum theorems for triangles and quadrilaterals
- Properties of intersecting lines
	- Congruence of vertically opposite angles
- Relationships involving angles in parallel lines with a transversal
	- Corresponding, alternate, interior
- Isosceles angle theorem
	- Angles opposite to the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are also equal.
- Triangle congruence and similarity "tests"
- In a triangle, an exterior angle is the sum of the 2 remote interior angles

## Circles
- Circle: set of all points at a given distance $r$ from a given point $O$ called the centre

## Important Circle Theorems
1. The angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference

5. Angle between a tangent and the radius drawn at the point of contact is a right angle

1. Angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment

2. The 2 tangents drawn from a point to a circle are of equal length

3. The products of the intercepts of 2 intersecting chords are equal

4. The square of the length of the tangent from an external point is equal to the product of the intercepts of the secant passing through this point
