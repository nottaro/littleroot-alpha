> Little Timmy loves playing the new Pocket Monsters game his mommy got him for Christmas. It hasn’t been two weeks, but little Timmy’s already beaten the game using the totally awesome Charizard he got from Professor Oak. Little Timmy thinks he’s hot shit. Little Timmy is a spoiled brat because his pushover parents let him play video games for ten hours a day. 
> 
> And little Timmy is brimming with the naive confidence of an infant sloshing around in a loaded diaper.  Smug little Timmy invites his only friend, Next Door Kyle, over to battle. His sweaty hands can barely plug in his link cable, he’s so eager to show off his Charizard. It knows Fire Spin, Flamethrower, AND Fire Blast.

> “Daaaamn, Timwad,” says Kyle moments later through a mouthful of Gushers and Pepsi Blue, having 6-0’ed Timmy’s entire team with a single Golduck. “You’re so bad at this game. I bet you don’t even know what Rhyhorn evolves into.”

Originally my notes were on paper, but I'm working on copying them over! This is why my Methods ~~and Specialist~~ notes aren't complete...
- Update 5/4/2023: I've finished my Spec notes

I don't claim to have every single bit of information on these subjects, but I hope it's enough :)

These notes are on Obsidian, and run using [jzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0)'s Quartz, with Github Pages. You can also ask me on Discord for them.


> [!summary] Yellowstone National Park
> 
> The entirety of Yellowstone National Park is under the legal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, including a small part of the park that is actually in Idaho. According to US law, the jury for a trial has to come from the state and district in which the crime took place. However, since this small bit of Idaho has no people living in it, and is also part of a separate court district from the rest of the state, hypothetically the court would be unable to assemble a jury and thus unable to convict you.

~~Why do these notes take so long to sync.~~ It's because I added colons to my titles. Obsidian is racist.

## raahim's memoir 21/8/23
- ramadan, yes
- you can't eat food/drink water/swear/bathe during day
- it's not that hard after the few couple of days
- first month of the new lunar year
- for the past couple of years ramadan has been happening in the winter time
- in fact, the new year is already about a month in
- it also depends on where you are
- different places have different times
- it is something you should do at least once in life
- if you have the opportunity to do it, you must do it
- hajj: pilgrimage where they go back to mecca(spiritual birthplace), spiritual center of islam
	- used to be in jerusalem
	- then the prophet got a message from God saying to change direction
- have to pray every day, before the sun sets
- raahim prays in the morning and twice after school
- if he gets home on time, he prays at home
- he also prays in AL1 at school if he has to
- rules and regulations surrounding this
	- is not easy
	- tests faith
- travelling has different rules
	- if you know the direction to face and time, you're allowed to
- does not matter if it's private or public (praying)
- it's not compulsory when you are in the process of travelling
	- you have to make up for it once you've landed
	- as long as there's doubt, you don't have to
	- when you're sure of your surroundings, you have to pray
- Islam started 1400 years ago, around 600 AD
