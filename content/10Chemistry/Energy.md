## Energy
- Energy: capacity to do work
- Work: exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change
- Exothermic reaction gives out heat
- Endothermic reaction absorbs heat

### Direct + Indirect uses of Energy
**Direct**
-   Burning petrol to power a car
-   Burn car to power a steam train
-   Burn natural gas to use a stove to cook eggs
**Indirect**
-   Takes energy to process crude oil to separate petrol. Then consumers use the petrol to power the car
-   Burning coal to spin turbines to generate electricity to charge a laptop. Consumers use the energy stored in the laptop
-   Truck bringing of diesel to transport eggs to consumers

## Greenhouse Effect
- Complete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon dioxide and water
- Incomplete combustion: reacts with air to produce carbon monoxide and water, or carbon and water

With the burning of fossil fuels, we put a lot of carbon dioxide into the air. 

Cause + Effect enhanced
1.  Extra burning of fossil fuels
2.  Enhanced greenhouse effect
3.  Average global temperatures rise
4.  Ice melting and sea level rises

- Some sunlight is absorbed by greenhouse gases. However, the kinetic energy formed by the greenhouse gasses moving and the absorbed sunlight, heats up the earth



# **Combustion**
- Combustion: substance burns in the presence of oxygen
	-   Reaction between a substance and oxygen that releases heat and light energy
- Fuel: substance that reacts with oxygen (combusts) to produce useful energy
- Many fractions obtained from crude oil are used as fuels because they contain hydrocarbons that burn easily and release a large amount of useful energy
- Complete combustion: lots of oxygen present
	-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —> Carbon dioxide + water + energy
- If there is a shortage of air(oxygen), incomplete combustion takes place
- Incomplete combustion: limited oxygen present
	-   Hydrocarbon + oxygen —> Carbon dioxide + water + energy
	-   Still yields carbon dioxide and water
	-   However, it produces toxic by-products, in CO and C
	-   Also releases less energy than complete oxygen
	-   Carbon monoxide is poisonous because it reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen, and reduces the ability of blood to expel carbon dioxide

### **Balancing equations: Combustion**
1.  Balance C
2.  Balance H
3.  If oxygen is an odd number, times everything by 2

Heat of combustion is used to refer to the amount of heat released during a combustion reaction
-   Involves combustion of a measured mass of alcohol to heat a measured mass of water over a measured temperature rise
-   It is assumed that the total heat released by the combustion reaction will be absorbed by the water

The heat of combustion can be calculated with:$$\Delta H=mc \Delta t$$
-   ∆H: change in enthalpy (j)
-   m: mass of heated substance (g)
-   c: specific heat capacity of heated substance (˚C)
-   ∆T: change in temperature of heated substance

# **Energy in Chemical Change**

## **Understanding Energy**
-   Energy: capacity to do work
-   Measured in Joules
-   Can be transferred or transformed
-   Can therefore come in different forms
	-   Potential energy
	-   Chemical energy
	-   Nuclear energy
	-   Mechanical energy
	-   Elastic energy
	-   Gravitational energy
	-   Kinetic energy
	-   Heat energy
	-   Light energy
	-   Electrical energy
	-   Sound energy
-   Enthalpy: changes taking place in a chemical reaction
-   Total energy present in a reaction
-   △H = H(products) - H(reactants)
-   H: enthalpy
-   △H: change in enthalpy

**2 prefixes: system and surroundings**

**System**: the area in which the chemical reaction happens

**Surroundings**: Contents outside the system that energy is transferred to/from

**2 types of reactions**

Exothermic reactions: transfers energy from system to surroundings
-   Energy is released
-   Bonds are broken
-   Heat is transferred/released from system to surroundings

Endothermic reactions: transfers energy from surroundings to system
-   Heat is transferred/absorbed from surroundings to system

Energy is stored in chemical bonds, known as chemical potential energy, or bond energy

Exothermic reactions have a negative value for △H, meaning enthalpy has decreased for the duration of the reaction
-   Happens if chemical potential energy is converted to particle kinetic energy, e.g. increase in temperature
-   Overall chemical potential energy is conserved in the form of heat
-   However, this raises the system’s temperature, so heat flows away from the system to the surroundings
-   The loss of heat energy from the system to the surroundings means that enthalpy has decreased

Endothermic reactions have a positive value for △H, meaning enthalpy has increased for the duration of the reaction 
-   Particle kinetic energy is converted to chemical potential energy
-   Reduction of particle kinetic energy means reacting system’s temperature will fall
-   Heat flows from the surroundings to the system, increasing enthalpy

## **Representing Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions**
-   Enthalpy change can be shown graphically using an energy profile graph, or it can be written along with the equation 
-   Sometimes the heat absorbed or released during the reaction is written into the equation, rather than giving the enthalpy change

- When a catalyst is used, less energy is needed for a reaction to occur
- Activation energy: amount of energy required to start/sustain reaction
- catalyst: substance that lowers activation energy of the reaction, and is not consumed during the reaction
