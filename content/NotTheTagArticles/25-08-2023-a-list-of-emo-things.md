Hypothesis: If someone follows the following conjectures and theorems, then they are proposed to be an "emo", that is, an emotional being.

### Conjecture 1. They have an OMORI profile picture
Omori is literally a game about depression. Having a profile picture of omori literally means that you relate to those depressed characters. "Sunny just like me fr" energy.

### Conjecture 2. They have long hair
Oh no, my hair blocks my eyes so I don't have to see how horrible the world is!

### Conjecture 3. Their favourite colour is black, or "the colour of blood"
Wow. How dark. They do this to absorb all the darkness around them, so others don't have to

### Conjecture 4. They like Yuri from DDLC
Literally the sadistic girl. There's no way.

### Conjecture 5. They have one expression. Sad.
Need I say more?

### Conjecture 6. They listen to sad music
Yeah we get it, you listen to Ruth B. Shut up, please.

### Conjecture 7. They play Undertale AUs
What a geek/nerd

Just a joke, just a joke. Intended to be purely fictional and humorous. For legal reasons, it's a joke. Intended in humour. By no means am I encouraging the mocking of "emo"s.
