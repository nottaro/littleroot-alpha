~~Like the hit song "Should I Stay or Should I Go" by The Clash?~~

But seriously.

I'm in a bit of a pickle right now. A conundrum, if you will.

Currently, I'm in a conflict of sorts. I'll publish my full story when I finish school, so I don't have to worry about being confronted at school.

This conflict has...messed me up. I've been through depression, had anxiety, a mild amount of trauma and PTSD, and have had to see a psychologist. ~~There's also the thoughts~~. 

It's not like it's getting better, either. I have to sit with them, knowing that they do not feel any sort of regret about their actions. They could do the same thing again and again and not care.

My friends? Some of them care. Enough to argue for me, in a private "friends" group chat that they're in. And that's not a bad thing. I'm grateful that they're my friends, that I have support, and that I can always count on them when I'm in trouble.

But what if this tears apart the group?

Would things be different if I just....left?

Would things be better?

Would I be happier?

I don't know. I don't know. I'd miss my friends, of course, but some of them have done nothing but encourage my "integration" with this person.

Maybe it's just easier if I left.

Would it make it better?

Would I want to?

That's all for today
