I'm high on anger and no sleep.

Right now, life isn't as great as it could be.

My friends are controlling my social life.

My parents are controlling my school life.

I basically have nothing to do.

Don't let other people decide what you want to do. It's your life, you get to choose. No-one else can tell you what's right for you.

I'm 16 now. I'm gonna enter the workforce in less than a decade. 

Do what you want to do.

Also. Don't waste your school life. You're young, and there's precious few happy moments that you can get. Make those memories.

Right now, I can't wait to get out of school. Don't be like me. Enjoy every single second of your youth, because every memory you ever make, you'll look back and remember, "Should I have done things differently?"

Try as hard as you can to get where you want to be. You don't want to be thinking "If I tried harder, would I be happier?"

So...that's all I guess.
