## Authors

## Hypothesis

**If something exists (has matter), it shall then tend towards either Anthony Du or Frederick Yap.**

**Frederick and Anthony are celestial being in orbit of one another. The impact collision of these two orbits will create a seismic event of unmeasurable proportions. This will result in a non-elastic collision with energy greater after the collision.**

### Christian

**Frederick and Anthony are points of order and stability. By definition, being Christian means anarchy and hence does not tend towards either.**

**Christian is a catalyst for other objects of matter and accelerates their approach to either.**
