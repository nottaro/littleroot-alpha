A conversation between me (Jujutsushi) and my friend, Mango


**Mango:** 
You, skin-having one. Do you believe you do not need the leaves? I will test your abilities to see if this is true.

**Jujutsushi:** 
Shutteth the helleth up, abhorrent daemon
Begone, beast
Be banished back to the darklands from whence you came

**Mango:**
au contraire, we leaved ones bathe in the light, it is you who are cloaked in shadow

**Jujutsushi:**
Mon frere, it is thou who art mistaken
Those flocked in leaves absorb all light from the land 
Thou art a cursed species 
An abomination to be expunged

**Mango:**
should you join us we may deem you worthy of sharing the light, or should we settle this through a true test of skill, a *dandori battle*

**Jujutsushi:**
My arcane volumes hold no record of this dandori battle

**Mango:**
dandori issue it seems you haveth

**Jujutsushi:**
Thou art a waste of air, O leaved one 
Pray tell, what is this dandori battle

**Mango:**
Dandori is the art of organizing your tasks strategically and working with maximum efficiency to execute your plans quickly. As such, you must collect more items during a set window than your opponent to reign supreme 
alternatively, you chucketh the pikmin at everything in sight

**Jujutsushi:**
'tis a misfortune i cannot partake in this dandori battle 
otherwise i would tan the skin off your backside

**Mango:**
you are the skin-having one here

**Jujutsushi:**
my apologies, i shall prune thyself of thy leaves

**Mango:**
(imagine someone walking up to you irl and saying "You! Skin-having one")

**Jujutsushi:**
(imagine if they turn around and they have no skin because of an operation) 

**Mango:**
(imagine their head is covered in leaves and they have a weird green dog with them)
