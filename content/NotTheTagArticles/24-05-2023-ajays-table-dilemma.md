Paraphrased very slightly.

So. This is quite an interesting image, isn't it. My best friend Ajay Bisnath, Student Councillor of Perth Modern, has started to use Obsidian. 

Ajay here is trying to make a table using the Advanced Tables Plugin. Ajay has been using Obsidian for two weeks and has already discovered community plugins. Ajay thinks he's hot sh-t. And Ajay is brimming with the confidence of a 10 year old who just walked into a national chess tournament.

Ajay found this problem here, and asks Jonathan for help. He says, "Golly gee darn, there's no way he can solve it!" 
Jonathan takes a look at it, and tells him to do the table again. Ajay, outraged at the 5 minutes that he lost from making the table, challenges Jonathan to complete it faster than him. Amazingly, Jonathan does.

Ajay is amazed, and then finds out why his table wasn't working. Embarrassed, he doesn't tell Jonathan. 

Jonathan immediately notices and then proceeds to slam him on how he didn't notice. He put the title above the table, which ruins the plugin.

Ajay leaves the voice chat. Jonathan starts to dance.

Ajay rejoins, and then proceeds to say, "At least we know what happened," to which Jonathan responds to "We? You didn't do jack sh-t." 
Ajay then says, "At least now we can fix our mistake," where Jonathan goes, "Our? It's your fault!"

Then Ajay proceeds to start playing Putt Party with Jonathan, where he gets his ass handed to him.

Bye!
