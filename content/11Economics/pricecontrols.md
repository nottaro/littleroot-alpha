## Price Floor

-   Minimum price (lower price limit) allowed by legislation
-   Government believes equilibrium price is too low
-   Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be below the minimum price allowed
-   For a price floor to be effective, the legislated price, $P_{min}$, must be above the market equilibrium price
-   Surplus occurs, as $Q_{supplied}>Q_{demanded}$
-   Quantity transacted will fall
-   Consumer surplus will fall
-   With government intervention, producers can earn more
-   A **minimum wag**e may help reduce the income gap between higher and lower wage earners

## Price Ceiling

-   Opposite of a price floor
-   Maximum price (upper price limit) allowed by legislation
-   Prices of all affected goods or services transacted cannot be above the maximum price allowed
-   For a price ceiling to be effective, the legislated price $P_{max}$ must be below the equilibrium price
- Shortage occurs, as $Q_{demanded} > Q_{supplied}$
-   What alternative means of resource allocation can replace the price mechanism, now that a price ceiling is imposed?
    1.  First come, first serve
    2.  Rationing
    3.  Government

### Black Markets
-   Any market where goods or services are sold illegally at prices above the legal price ceiling
-   Exists because buyers are *********willing and able to pay higher than the legal price ceiling*************** at the transacted quantity
-   Profits can be made by those buying at the controlled price and selling at the black market price
