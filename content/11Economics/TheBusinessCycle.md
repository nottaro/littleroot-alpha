## Business Trade Cycle (BTC)
- Describes fluctuations in the growth of real output, consisting of alternating periods of expansion (increasing real output) and contraction (decreasing real output)
- A business cycle plots **real GDP** on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis
- GDP here is measured in real terms, so that the vertical axis measures changes in the volume of output produced after the influence of price-level changes has been eliminated

## Phases of the BTC

### Expansion
- An expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP, shown by these parts of the curve that slope upwards
- During periods of real GDP growth, **employment of resources increases**, and the **general price level** of the economy (which is an average over all prices) usually begins to rise more rapidly (this is known as **inflation**)

### Peak
- A peak represents the cycle's maximum real GDP, and marks the end of the expansion
- When the economy reaches a peak, unemployment of resources has fallen substantially, and the general price level may be rising quit rapidly. 
	- The economy is likely to be experiencing inflation

### Contraction
- Following the peak, the economy begins to experience falling real GDP (negative growth), shown by the downwards sloping parts of the curve
- **If the contraction lasts 6 months (2 quarters) or more, it is termed a recession, characterised by falling real GDP, and growing unemployment of resources**
- Increases in the price level may slow down a lot, and it is even possible that prices in some sectors may begin to fall
- Deflation: outright fall in prices
- Disinflation: rising general prices at a falling rate

### Trough
- A trough represents the cycle's minimum level of GDP, or the end of the contraction
- There may now be widespread unemployment
- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion (also known as a recovery), marking the beginning of a new cycle

## Indicators
- An indicator is anything that can be used to predict future financial or economic trends
- For example, the social and economic statistics published by accredited sources, such as the various departments in the government, are indicators
- Some of the popular indicators they put out include unemployment rates, housing stats, inflationary index, and consumer confidence
- Official indicators must meet certain set criteria; there are **three categories** of indicators, classified according to the types of predictions they make

### Leading indicators
- Signal future events
1. Share prices
	1. Share prices go up in response to an increase in demand
	2. Indicates company performance
2. Building approvals
	1. More building approvals - more demand for building
3. Levels of stock (inventory) held by firms
	1. If inventory level rises, demand rises
	2. If inventory level falls, demand is falling
4. Manufacturers new orders
5. Business and consumer confidence
	1. Falling confidence means falling growth
6. Consumer expectations
7. New employment vacancies
8. New business start-ups

### Lagging Indicators
- One that follows an event
1. Interest rates
2. Consumer debt
3. Unemployment rate
4. Bankruptcies
5. Inflation rate

### Coincident indicators
- Occur at approximately the same time as the conditions they signify
- Change at the same time as the economy/stock market
1. GDP
2. Manufacturing output
3. Sales of consumer durables
4. Production of building materials
5. Retail sales
6. Job advertisements
7. Motor vehicle sales
8. Money supply
9. Capacity utilisation

### Summary:
- Leadding indicators move ahead of the
