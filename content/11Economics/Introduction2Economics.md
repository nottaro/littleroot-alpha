### Macro-economics vs Micro-economics

-   Macro-economics and Micro-economics are 2 of the largest subdivisions of the study of economics
-   Micro- refers to the observation of small economics units
    -   Effects of government regulations on individual markets and consumer decision making
-   Macro- refers to the “big picture” version of economics
    -   How interest rates are determined
    -   Why some economics grow faster than others

### Micro-economics

-   Individual markets
-   Consumers
-   Producers/firrms
-   Government
-   How their actions influence decisions and individual markets
-   Utility maximisation/satisfaction
-   Firm production and profit maximisation
-   Individual market equilibrium
-   Effects of government regulations on individual markets
-   Externalities and other side effects

### Macro-economics

-   The big picture
-   Focuses on aggregate production and consumption in an economy
    -   Effects of general taxes such as income and sales taxes on output and prices
    -   Causes of economics upswings and downturns
    -   Effects of monetary and fiscal policies on economics health
    -   Effects of, and process for, determining interest rates
    -   Causes for some economies growing faster than other economies
    -   Uses GDP **(**Gross Domestic Product: monetary value of all finished goods and services within a give time period**)** and goods and services by their market price
    -   Inflation, unemployment rate, GDP

### Scarcity

-   We have unlimited wants and limited resources to satisfy those wwants
-   There is a scarcity of resources
-   Resources have alternative uses

### Basic Economic Problem (BEP)

-   BEP is every and affects us all
-   Due to the problem of “relative scarcity”
    -   Scarcity relative to our wants
-   Resources may be abundant but wants are unlimited, how are the resources allocated: relative scarcity
-   Due to scarcity, we are forced to make choices
-   Resources cannot be used for all human wants
-   We must choose
-   ****************************************We have unlimited wants, but there is a scarcity of resources to satisfy those wants. Therefore, a choice must be made.****************************************

### Opportunity Cost

-   When a choice is made, it involves a sacrifice known as an opportunity cost
-   ********************************************************************************Real cost of the next best alternative forgone******************************************************************************** based on a choice or decision
-   Usually measured in terms of goods/services or monetary value given up (relative to the alternative course of action)

### Possibility Production Frontier (PPF)

-   Model that demonstrates how opportunity costs arise when individuals or the community makes choices
-   Shows the various combinations of 2 alternative products that can be produced
    -   Assuming that:
        -   Technology is constant/fixed
        -   There is a fixed quantity of resources
        -   All resources are used to their fullest capacity
        -   Economy can only produce 2 goods/services
-   Points inside the curve are inefficient: resources are not being used to their fullest extent
-   Points on the curve are attainable, and resources have been used to their fullest extent
-   Points outside the curve are desirable but unattainable, as we have a scarcity of resources, and our technology is fixed, so we cannot achieve those points

## Free Goods and Economic Goods

### Free Goods

-   Free good is any good that is not scarce
-   Therefore has no opportunity cost
-   Not limited by scarcity
-   Therefore, it includes anything that can be obtained without sacrificing something else
-   E.g., sunlight

### Economics Goods

-   Any good that is scarce, either because it is a naturally occuring scarce resource:
    -   Oil
    -   Gold
    -   Coal
    -   Forests/wood
    -   Lakes/water
-   OR because it is produced by scarce resources
-   All economic goods have an opportunity cost lower than 0
-   ************************2 types of goods that are available free of charge but which do have opportunity costs and are therefore economic goods************************
    -   Goods provided by the government (paid by tax-payer’s money)
    -   Certain natural resources that are not owned by anyone are called common pool resources
        -   Also considered economic goods because they are scarce, and are becoming increasingly scarce due to overuse and depletion
        -   E.g., clean air, wildlife, lakes, forests, rivers

************************************************************************************************************************************************************A good can be a free good in certain situations and an economic good in others************************************************************************************************************************************************************

-   E.g., oxygen out in the countryside is a free good, but in a crowded room, it becomes an economic good

********************************************************************************************************************************************************Important to distinguish free goods from goods that are available free of charge to their users********************************************************************************************************************************************************

## Basic Economic Questions

-   All economies/countries face scarce resources and unlimited wants
-   Decisions have to be made regarding the use of resources
-   So an economy has to have a system to answer the 4 basic economic questions
    -   What to produce?
    -   How to produce?
    -   How much to produce?
    -   For whom to produce?
-   Given unlimited wants, but scarce resources, so a choice must be made

## Positive and Normative Concepts

-   Economists think about the economic world in 2 ways
-   1 way tries to explain how things in the economy actually work
    -   Positive Concepts
    -   Based on facts/models
-   The other deals with how things ought to work
    -   Normative Concepts
    -   Based on opinions

### Positive Concepts

-   Positive statements can be true or false
-   Based on facts and models
-   Describes how things actually work in the economy

### Normative Concepts

-   Normative statements can only be assessed relative to values, opinions, and judgements
-   Cannot be true or false
-   Describes how things should/ought to work in the economy

## 4 Factors of Production (FOP)

-   **Land:** Natural resources
-   ********Labour************: Physical or mental effort used to produce goods/services
-   **************Capital**************: Artificial **FOP** used to produce goods and services. Goods that make other goods/services
    -   Physical capital: investment goods
    -   Investment: spending on capital goods
-   ********Enterprise********: Skill used to organise all other **FOP**
