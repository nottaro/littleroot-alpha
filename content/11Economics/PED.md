- Measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price, ceteris paribus

-   Depends on what %Δ you want, use price for price, and QD for QD
-   Elasticity declines along demand curve as we move towards quantity axis

## Elasticities

-   When price elasticity is between $0$ and $-1$, demand is **************************price inelastic***************************
-   When price elasticity is between $-1$ and $- ∞$, demand is **************************price elastic**************************
-   When price elasticity is $-1$, demand is **unit price elastic**
-   When DD is price elastic, the slope of the DD curve is gentler
-   When DD is price inelastic, the slope of the DD curve is steeper
-   **************************Price Elastic:**************************** Price change results in a more than proportionate change in quantity demanded
-   ********************Price Inelastic:********************** Price change results in a less than proportionate change in quantity demanded
-   **************************************Unit Price Elastic:************************************** Price change results in a proportionate change in quantity demanded
    

## Factors that Affect PED for a Good

1.  Number and closeness of substitutes in the same price range
2.  Time period
3.  Proportion of income consumers spend on a good
4.  Degree of necessity of the good to the consumers
5.  Habit of the consumer

### Number and Closeness of Substitutes in the Same Price Range

- The longer the number of substitutes (in the same price range), the higher the PED, and ********************vice versa********************

### Time Period

-   The longer the time period, the higher the PED
-   More scope for the discovery of new substitutes
-   More receptive to new products
-   Availability of substitutes

### Proportion of Income Consumers Spend on a Good: Lower

-   The lower the proportion of income spent on a good, the lower the PED
-   Only a small proportion of income (won’t affect PED)
-   If price increases, quantity demanded will decrease less than proportionately
-   Less responsive to price changes, no incentive to look for substitutes
-   Demand is price inelastic

### Proportion of Income Consumers Spend on a Good: Higher

-   The higher the proportion of income spent on the good, the higher the PED
-   Very large proportion of income
-   If price increases, quantity demanded will decrease more than proportionately
-   Very responsive to price changes
-   Demand is price elastic

### Degree of Necessity of the Good to the Consumers: Higher

-   The higher the degree of necessity, the lower the PED
-   Essential to satisfy needs
-   If price increases, quantity demanded will decreases less that proportionately
-   Less responsive to price changes
-   Demand is price inelastic

### Degree of Necessity of the Good to the Consumers: Lower

-   The lower the degree of necessity, the higher the PED
-   **Luxury items** are not essential to satisfy needs
-   If price increases, quantity demanded will decrease more than proportionately
-   Sensitive to price change
-   Demand is price elastic

### Habit of the Consumer

-   If the goods are consumed out of habit, an increase in price leads to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
-   Demand is price inelastic

## Total Revenue and PED

-   **Why is a knowledge of PED useful to firms?**
    -   Allows firms to adjust price to maximise profit

$$ Profit = Total \ Revenue - Total\ Loss $$

$$ Total\ Revenue=Price\times Quantity_{traded} $$

-   When the demand for a good is price elastic, an increase in price results in a decrease in total revenue for the firm/producer
	-   Therefore, when the demand for a good is price elastic, the firm/producer should decrease the price of the good so that total revenue increases
-   When the demand for a good is price inelastic, a decrease in price results in a decrease in total revenue for the firm/producer
	-   Therefore, when the demand for a good is price inelastic, the firm/producer should increase the price of the good so that total revenue increases
