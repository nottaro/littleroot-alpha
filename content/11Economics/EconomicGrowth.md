	- **Expenditure approach**: Adds up all spending to buy final goods and services produced within a country over a time period
		- $C+I+G+(X-M)$
	- **Income approach**: Adds up all income earned by the factors of production that reduce all goods and services within a country over a time period
	- **Output approach**: calculates the value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a time period
