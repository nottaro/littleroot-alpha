- An economic situation when there is a sustained increase in the general price level
	- General price level: all prices, not the price of one good
	- Sustained increase: Continuous, not a one-time increase
- Inflation is defined as a persistent and appreciable rise in the general level of prices (noticeable price increases that occur over time, and across a range of goods)

## Measuring Inflation
- Inflation refers to the rate of change of the general price level (GPL).
- The inflation rate over a period of time is measured by the percentage rate of change using a given price index
- Rate of inflation is basically the rate of change
-  That is, $\frac{x_2 - x_1}{x_1} \times 100\%$
- Types of price indices
	- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
	- Retail Price Index (RPI)
	- Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
	- Producer Price Index (PPI)

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services
- It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods/services and averaging them
- The goods are weighted according to their importance
- Inflation refers to the rate of change of GPL
- The inflation rate between any two periods of time is measured by the percentage rate of change in the relevant price index

## Causes of Inflation

### Demand-Pull Inflation
- Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand (AD) rises at a rate that is not matched by the output of goods and services (Aggregate Supply)
- What causes an increase in AD leading to rightward shift of AD curve?
	- AD = C + I + G + (X – M)
	- Rise in consumption expenditure by households
	- Rise in firms’ investment expenditure
	- Rise in demand for country’s exports
	- Excessive speculative spending
	- Rise in government expenditure or decrease tax
	- Expansionary fiscal or monetary policy

### Cost-Pull Inflation
- Cost Push Inflation occurs when rising production costs (cost of production) are passed on to consumers who then pay higher prices for final goods and services.
- Costs reflect the prices paid for productive inputs.
- Periods of cost push inflation can be attributed to increases in prices of significant productive inputs. (for example, crude oil, wheat, labour, etc.)
- Wage Pull Inflation
	- Caused by persistent rise in wages without corresponding rise in labour productivity
- Import Price- Push Inflation
	- Caused by rising import prices resulting in rise in imported consumer goods & raw materials
- Profit Push Inflation
	- Caused by firms making use of their market power to make higher profits by raising prices
- Tax Push Inflation
	- Caused by increase in taxation
- Exhaustion of Natural Resources
	- Caused by depletion of major natural resources for example due to natural disasters

### In Summary

| Type of Inflation   | Demand-pull Inflation                                                  | Cost-pull Inflation                                                  |     |     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| Causes of inflation | Caused by persistent increases in AD not matched by output of G&S (AS) | Caused by persistent rises in costs of production, independent of AD |     |     |

### Loss of Confidence in Currency
- As GPL rises, purchasing power of money falls, ceteris paribus.
- Domestic currency will have lower purchasing power $\rightarrow$ undermine people’s confidence in the currency $\rightarrow$ less willing to hold money.
- Internal value of money falls $\rightarrow$ people will preserve wealth by buying assets or foreign currencies
- Domestic currency depreciates (due to lower demand) and assets further increase in price
