## Negative Externalities of Production
### Government regulations
- Rely on "command" approach, using authority to enact legislation and regulations in the public's interest
- Regulations can be used to prevent or reduce the effects of production externalities
- In the case of the polluting firm, regulations can forbid the dumping of certain toxic substances into the environment
- More commonly, regulations do not totally ban the production of pollutants, but rather attempt to achieve one of the following
	1. Limit the emission of pollutants by setting a maximum limit of pollutants permitted
	2. Limit the quantity of output produced by the producer
	3. Require polluting firms to install technologies reducing the emissions
- The impact is to lower the quantity of the good produced and bring it to the optimal supply curve by shifting MPC up to MSC
- Pollutant and output restrictions achieve this by forcing the firm to produce less.
- Requirements to install technologies reducing emissions achieve this by imposing higher costs of production due to the purchase of the non-polluting technologies.
- Ideally, the higher costs of production would be equal to the value of the negative externality.
- The governmentâ€™s objective is to make the MPC curve shift upwards until it coincides with the MSC curve, in which case Qopt is produced, price increases from Pm to Popt, and the problem of overallocation of resources to the production of the good is corrected. 
- If polluting firms do not comply with the regulations, they would have to pay fines.
