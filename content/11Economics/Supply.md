[go back](11Subjects/11Economics.md)

-   Amount of a good or service a producer is willing and able to sell in a given period of time, at a given price, ceteris paribus
-   Objective of producers is to ********************************maximise profits********************************
    -   $Profit = Revenue-Costs$
-   ****************************Law of Supply:**************************** In a given time period, the quantity supplied of a good or service is directly related to its price, ceteris paribus
-   Produces aim to ********************************maximise profit********************************, while consumers aim to ******************************************maximise satisfaction******************************************
-   **************************************Individual Supply:************************************** Refers to the sum of the individual supply for a good or service by all the producers in the market
-   ************************Market Supply:************************ Refers to the sum of all the individual supply for a good or service by all the producers in the market
-   **********Exceptional Supply Curves**********
    -   Vertical supply curve
    -   No matter the price, the same quantity is supplied
    -   E.g., rare antiques

## Non-Price Supply Factors

### Change in Price of Factor Inputs

-   Factor prices: refers to the cost of factors of production
-   Affects cost

1.  Factor prices increase
2.  Cost of production increases
3.  More expensive to produce goods and services
4.  Producers cut down on supply
5.  ****************************And vice versa****************************

### Changes in Expectations about Future Price Changes

-   If the seller expects the price of a good to rise in the future, the seller will store the goods now in order to sell more in the future
-   On the other hand, if the price of the good is expected to drop in the near future, sellers will earn more by placing goods on the market immediately before the price falls
-   Expectations of higher prices will reduce supply
-   Expectations of lower prices will increase supply

### Changes in State of Technology

-   Technological changes take place over time as a result of innovation and expertise
-   With improved production methods, factors of production would be more productive
-   The production of goods would increase, thus supply increases

### Effects Affecting Availability of Resources and the Supply Chain

-   Changes in weather conditions
-   Natural disasters
-   Climate change
-   War

### Changes in Number of Suppliers

-   Increased suppliers of a good or service increase supply, and ************vice versa************
-   Shifts supply curve over to the right, or left for decreased number of suppliers
-   Suppliers may enter or leave an industry due to business outlook
    -   E.g., decrease in profit over time
