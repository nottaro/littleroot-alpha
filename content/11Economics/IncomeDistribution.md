## Income and Wealth; the difference
- Income and wealth are different concepts
- One represents a flow of funds (income)
- The other represents a stock of assets (wealth)
- They are closely linked; the more income a household has, the greater the capacity for building wealth over time

### Income
- Most households have more than one source of private income
	- Wages
	- Salaries
	- Investment
	- Pension
- **Gross income** is determined by adding any transfers a household receives from government e.g. pension
- Direct taxes are deducted to determine **disposable income**
- Gross income is before taxes, disposable income is after taxes
- Most households also receive some form of indirect benefit (social transfers) such as assistance with school fees or healthcare costs, which add to final income

### Wealth
- The current value of the assets a household has accumulated over time through savings; financial investments, business profits, inheritance
- The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) defines wealth as the difference between a household's assets (what you own) and its liabilities (what you owe)
	- If liabilities exceed assets, you are in debt
- Household assets are generally held as property, shares, savings and superannuation, while liabilities include mortgages, personal loans, and credit card debt
