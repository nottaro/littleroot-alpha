## Markets

-   Where Buyers and Sellers meet in order to exchange money for goods
    -   They do not always meet in person
-   Goods can be bought by consumers and sold by suppliers in online markets, e.g., Amazon
-   Amount of money a consumer pays the supplier in exchange for a good/service is called the ********price*********
-   There are markets for the factors of production
-   Labour is needed by producers to make goods
-   The producers are the buyers of labour and individual people are the sellers of their own labour

### Product Markets

-   Product markets deal with the buying/selling of goods and services
-   Consumers represent the demand side of the market, while producers/firms represent the supply side
-   Firms produce goods and services and sell them to households (consumers)

### Factor Markets

-   Deal in the buying and selling for factors of production or resources
    -   E.g., labour market
-   In a factor market, households sell their resources to firms
-   Households represent the supply side of the market
-   Firms represent the demand side

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Markets can also be classified according to the intensity of competition in the market****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

### Competitive Markets

-   Large number of buyers and sellers
-   Firms are price takers (no power over price), must take price established by market
-   Very similar (homogenous) products
-   Easy entry into market (no barriers to entry or exit)
-   Price is determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers
-   No individual buyer or seller can influence the market price
    -   No market power

### Imperfect Market

-   Not competitive
-   A.k.a. non-competitive market
-   Small number of firms
-   Product differentiation
-   Firms are price setters, can set their own price
    -   They have market power
-   Entry into market is restricted (barriers to entry), makes it harder to have competition
-   E.g. Mobile Phones, Water Corporation
-   Monopoly, Oligopoly
    -   Monopoly: One seller or producer is the sole supplier of a good/service in a market
    -   Oligopoly: Small number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having significant influence. **I.e.**, a few sellers/producers are the sole suppliers of a good/service in a market
-   Firms try to make their products look “different” in their consumer’s eyes

# Demand

-   Amount of a good/service consumers are willing and able to buy in a given period of time at a given price, ceteris paribus
    -   Ceteris paribus: other things remaining constant
-   A.k.a. **effective demand**
-   _**Law of Demand:**_ Quantity demanded of a product is inversely related to its price, in a given period of time, ceteris paribus
-   ********************************Individual Demand:************************************ Demand for a good or service by an individual consumer
-   **Market Demand:** Sum of the individual demand for a good or service by all of the consumers in the market

**********Non-Price Factors affecting Ability and Willingness to buy**********

1.  Demographic Changes, e.g. size/composition of population
2.  Changes in expectations about future price changes
3.  Changes in Consumer’s Money income
4.  Changes in Price/Demand of related goods
5.  Changes in consumer tastes and preferences


### Changes in Price/Demand of Related Goods

**Substitutes**

-   Alternative product that can replace another because it satisfies the same want
-   A.k.a. competitive demand
-   If the price of one good changes, the demand for the substitute good will change in the same direction

********************Complements*********************

-   Complementary products must be used at the same time with another to satisfy the same human wants
-   A.k.a. joint demand
-   Separate products, but are consumed at the same time
-   If the price of one good changes, the demand for the complementary good will change in the opposite direction

********************************************Goods in Derived Demand*********************************************

-   When a good is in derived demand, it is demanded for its contribution to the manufacture of another product
-   Usually raw materials, e.g. wood
-   For 2 goods in derived demand, a change in demand for the final good causes a similar change in demand for the resource used to produce it

### Changes in Consumer’s Money Income

********************Normal Goods*********************

-   A good is a normal good when demand for it increases in response to an increase in consumer income
-   Demand for the good varies directly with income
-   Most goods are normal goods
    -   Luxury goods, necessities
-   Increase in income leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve, and vice versa
-   Purchasing power increases with income, therefore demand increases

**************************Inferior goods*************************

-   Goods where the demand falls as consumer income increases and vice versa
    -   E.g., cheaper alternatives, like flying with JetStar instead of Singapore Airlines
-   Demand for the good varies inversely with income
-   As income increases, consumers switch to more expensive alternatives, so the demand for the inferior good falls
-   Relative to wants
-   Increase in income leads to a leftward shift in the demand curve, and vice versa
-   When income changes, demand will change in the opposite direction

### Changes in Consumer Tastes and Preferences

-   The more desirable a good is to consumers, the higher the demand, and vice versa
-   Tastes and preferences are affected by advertisements, pop star appeal, age, peers, etc
    -   Advertisement campaigns

### Demographic Changes

-   Changes in size/composition of population
-   E.g., Age, if you are old, you will buy less athletic goods

### Changes in Expectations about Future Price Changes

-   If the price is expected to increase, demand will increase, so they have more purchasing power before the increase in price
    -   Demand curve shifts to the right
-   Vice versa

## Upward-Sloping Demand Curve

-   Ostentatious goods
    -   E.g., Luxury items, cars, watches
-   Price is directly related to quantity demanded
-   Higher price is perceived as higher quality, resulting in more being bought
