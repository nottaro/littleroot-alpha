-   Forces between molecules
-   Allotropes: Different physical forms of the same element
    -   E.g., carbon, diamond, graphite
-   Gases: Very weak attraction between particles
-   Liquid: stronger attraction between particles
-   Solids: Very strong attraction between particles
- Also known as Van Der Waal's forces

## Dispersion Forces
- Forces existing between 2 polar or non-polar molecules
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 oppositely charged temporary/induced dipoles
- Electrons move randomly; thus dipoles are temporary, as their charges is based on these electrons, as their localisation is temporary
- Molecules with dipoles can polarise other molecules and make them form temporary dipoles - these are called induced dipoles
- This ESF of attraction between the temporary and induced dipoles are known as dispersion forces
- These are temporary, as electrons move randomly, therefore the dipoles form, break apart, and reform randomly

## Ion-dipole Forces
- Forces existing between an ion and a polar molecule
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a dipole
- Note: "Intermolecular force" is a misnomer, as this is in ionic substances, not covalent substances
- Stronger than permanent dipole-dipole and dispersion forces

## Permanent Dipole-Dipole
- Forces present between 2 polar molecules
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 net dipoles; i.e. partially positive end of one dipole, and partially negative end of another, and vice versa
- Stronger than dispersion forces
	- They are permanent
	- There is a greater separation of charge, and therefore a greater ESF of attraction between the 2 dipoles
- Stronger than intramolecular forces
- Relatively weak compared to metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds

## Hydrogen Bonding
- Strong dipole-dipole attraction between an electron deficient hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom (N, O, F), and the lone pair of electrons on a highly electronegative atom on a different molecule $$H^{\delta+}-F^{\delta- }|||||||||H^{\delta+}-F^{\delta- }$$
	- Hydrogen is electron deficient, Fluorine is electronegative
	- Strong dipole-dipole forces
	- Hydrogen bonding represented as |||||||
- The bonds are stronger than dipole-dipole forces and dispersion forces
- Strongest of all intermolecular forces
	- They are permanent
	- There is a greater separation of charge, and therefore a greater ESF of attraction between the 2 dipoles
- Responsible for unique properties of water
	- Water has an interesting boiling point; $100ËšC$, low boiling point, but relatively high for its size
	- Universal solvent; polar compound; dissolves ionic compounds easily
	- Very high surface tension
	- Relationship between ice and water; ice floats in water, even though it shouldn't, as a solid
		- Ice is less dense than water
		- Hydrogen bonds become permanent when water freezes
		- Water molecules are held together in a unique 3D structure
