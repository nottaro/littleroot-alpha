- Residue: Substance that cannot be dissolved

## Ion-dipole forces 
- Electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a polar molecule
- Formed from the electrostatic force of attraction between an ion and a dipole
- Note: "Intermolecular force" is a misnomer, as this is in ionic substances, not covalent substances
- Stronger than permanent dipole-dipole and dispersion forces
- Ion – dipole forces form between ions of an ionic compound and molecules of water. We say the ions are hydrated.
- If the ion – dipole forces formed between ions and water are strong enough, they can pull ions off the surface of an ionic lattice, and the ionic substance is soluble.
- Not all ionic substances dissolve. In insoluble substances, the ionic bonding is too strong, and the ion – dipole bonds formed are not strong enough to break up the ionic lattice.

# Solubility

## Soluble or Insoluble?
- Solutions form when solvent and solute mix
- Process involves breaking bonds/attraction in these individual substances, which is endothermic, thus it requires energy
- In the solution, attractions form between the solvent and solute, and this bond formation is exothermic, releasing energy
- Whether the solution forms overall depends on whether the overall process is energetically favourable
	- i.e. if the amount of energy released from forming solute-solvent bonds is greater than the amount of energy breaking solute-solute and solvent-solvent bonds
- Dissolving can be exothermic or endothermic, but if too much energy is required, it won't happen
- **Like dissolves like** (do not use this phrase)
	- If the solvent and solute are able to form good intermolecular bonds with each other, this will favour dissolving
	- Polar solvents and polar solutes can form dipole-dipole interaction (and sometimes H-bonds), which favours dissolving
	- Non-polar substances cannot form dipole-dipole interactions or h-bonds, so won't mix with polar substances
	- Non-polar solutes dissolve well in non-polar solvents. All substances form only dispersion forces, meaning no strong bonds are broken

| When a solute is soluble in a specific solvent                                                                                                                                                                                              | When a solute is insoluble in a specific solvent                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| The intermolecular forces between the solvent and solute are stronger than the intermolecular forces present between the solvent's atoms, and the solute's atoms                                                                            | The intermolecular forces between the solvent & solute are weaker than the intermolecular forces present between the solvent & solvent and between the solutes                                                                             |
| This means the difference between the energy released in the formation of the intermolecular forces between the solvent & solute and the energy required to break the solute – solute and solvent – solvent intermolecular forces decreases | This means the difference between the energy released in the formation of the intermolecular forces between the solvent & solute and the energy required to break the solute – solute and solvent – solvent intermolecular forces is large |
| Thus the solvent – solvent and solute – solute IMF are able to be disrupted and the solute – solvent IMF are able to be established as this process is energetically favorable                                                              | Thus the solvent – solvent and solute – solute IMF are not able to be disrupted as this process is energetically unfavorable and so the solute does not dissolve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Water - The Universal Solvent
- As a highly polar molecule, water is great at dissolving polar molecule substances and many ionic substances
- Water can form a range of intermolecular forces to stabilise a solution
	- Dipole-dipole forces with polar molecules
	- Hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bonding polar molecules
	- Ion-dipole forces with ions from ionic compounds


### Aqueous Solutions of Covalent Compounds
- Many polar molecules are soluble in water due to the strong dipole-dipole forces or hydrogen bonds formed
- Organic compounds are usually non-polar, but if they have –OH (alcohol) or –NH (amine) groups, they can hydrogen bond, so this will increase their solubility in water
- Acids are molecular substances that ionise in water to form ions. This means they can form ion – dipole forces with water, and so are usually very soluble

## Solubility of ionic substances
- All ionic substances are soluble to some extent, so we categorise substances by the concentration of a saturated solution at 25˚ C. 
- A substance is described as soluble if a saturated solution is 0.1 mol L-1 or higher.
- A substance is described as slightly soluble if a saturated solution is 0.01 mol $L^{-1}$ to 0.1 mol $L^{-1}$. 
- A substance is described as insoluble if a saturated solution is below 0.01 mol L-1.

# Precipitation

## Precipitation Reactions
- An insoluble solid that forms during an aqueous reaction is called a precipitate. 
- A reaction which forms a precipitate is called a precipitation reaction
- The limewater test for carbon dioxide is a precipitation reaction
	- Limewater is actually a dilute solution of calcium hydroxide
	- The calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate, which is insoluble in water

### Uses of Precipitation Reactions
- Most precipitation reactions are very fast reactions that occur between ions.
- This makes them very useful for identifying specific ions based on the type of precipitate formed.
- Precipitation reactions have a number of other uses:
	- Production of coloured pigments for paints and dyes
	- Removal of toxic chemicals from water
	- Separation of reaction products.

### Spectator Ions
- In ionic precipitation reactions there are often ions that are not involved in the reaction. These are known as spectator ions.
- The spectator ions are easily identified using the ionic equation, where they are the ions that don't change their state of matter, or don't participate in the reaction
- You should always write net ionic equations, omitting spectator ions, in this course.

### Identifying Positive Ions
- Many metal ions can be identified by flame tests
- However, precipitation reactions can also be used to identify positive ions, as many metals form hydroxide precipitates with characteristic colours

### Identifying negative ions: Halides
- Formed from group 17 elements, the halogens
- Detected using silver nitrate solutions
- Colourless ions in a solution
- $I^-,Cl^-,Br^-$ 
- The different silver halide precipitates can be distinguished by their differing colours
	- Chloride: white AgCl precipitate
	- Bromide: cream AgBr precipitate
	- Iodide: yellow AgI precipitate


### Isolating the Precipitate
- Precipitate from a precipitation reaction can be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration
- A Buchner funnel and flask can be used to accelerate the process
	- This apparatus uses a vacuum pump to draw the mixture through the filter
	- The filtrate is finally washed and dried

# More Solubility

## Solubility
- Concentration of a saturated solution
- **Saturated**: Solution where no more solute will dissolve at the given temperature
- **Unsaturated**: Less solute than needed to make a saturated solution. Most solutions we use will be unsaturated
- **Supersaturated**: Unstable solution, usually formed as a saturated solution curves down. If it is disturbed, it will crystallise, forming crystals of solute, and leave a saturated solution
- **Solubility**: Mass of a substance that will dissolve in 100 g of water at 25˚ C
	- Measured in g/100g
- The solubility of a substance depends on the temperature of the solvent

### Solubility Curves
- Solubility curves show the solubility of substances as temperature changes
- Generally, the solubility of ionic solids increases with temperature
	- There is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid

### Saturation and Crystallisation
- Solutions become supersaturated when they contain more solute than they would normally be able to dissolve
- This can happen when a saturated solution is cooled, or another change in conditions occurs that causes solubility to decrease
- The solute will stay in solution until a ‘seed’ crystal is added. 
- This causes it to crystallise out of the solution very quickly.
- When it does this, it gives out heat energy.

### Solubility of Gases
- Many gases are soluble in water. 
	- For example, fish can breathe because of the oxygen dissolved in water.
- Solubility of gases in water is often low, as most gases are not very polar. More polar gases are more soluble, in general.
- As temperature increases, solubility of gases decreases
	- This is because the gases have more kinetic energy, which increases motion and breaks the IMF between the gases and the solvent, causing them to escape the solution
