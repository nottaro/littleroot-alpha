**Reactivity of Group 1 Metals increases as there are more valence electron shells**

ESF: Electrostatic Forces of Attraction

## Electron Trends in the Periodic Table

### Down a Group:

-   Number of outer shell electrons is the same
-   Number of complete electron shells increases by 1
-   Number of a group is the same as the number of electrons in the outer shell of elements in that group, except for group 0
-   Shielding increases
-   Atomic radius increases

### Across a Period (Left to Right)

-   Number of outer shell electrons increases by 1
-   Number of complete electron shells stays the same
-   The point at which a new period starts is the point at which electrons begin to fill a new shell
-   Nuclear Charge increases across a period
-   Shielding is the same across a period
-   Nuclear Attraction increases across a period

## Valency

-   Valency is the combining power of an atom
-   Equal to number of hydrogen atoms it can combine with or displace from a compound
    -   Valency of hydrogen is 1
-   Valency is not the same as the number of valence electrons
    -   e.g., Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons but its valency is 3

## Atomic Radius

-   **Atomic Radius:** Distance from the outermost valence electron to the nucleus
-   Atomic Radius decreases across a period
    -   The outer electrons are in the same shell but the increasing net nuclear attraction pulls the outer electrons closer to the nucleus
-   Increases down a group
    -   Number of protons increases, however, number of shielding electrons increases too. Effective nuclear charge therefore remains approx. constant
    -   Increase in radius is due to **higher** principle energy levels being filed, and valency energy level is located **************further************** from the nucleus
-   Largest atomic radius is **************Caesium************** (Cs)

## Electronegativity

-   **************************************Electronegativity:************************************** Ability of an atom to attract bonding pair of electrons in a covalent bond
    -   In a covalent bond between 2 different elements, the electron density is not shared equally
        -   $Cl_2$ has a bonding pair of electrons, shared equally
        -   $HCl$ has a bonding pair of electrons not shared equally
        -   Chlorine is more electronegative
            -   Has a greater ability to attract a bonding pair of electrons not shared equally than carbon
-   **Decreases down a group**
    -   Down a group, there is an increase in atomic radius
    -   Leads to weaker ESF between the nucleus and the furthermost valence electron
        -   Because shielding effect increases, i.e., repulsion from core electrons
-   **Increases across a period**
    -   Increase in number of protons
    -   Increase in positive charge in the nucleus
    -   Increased ESF between valence electrons and the nucleus
    -   Decrease in atomic radius, increase in ESF
-   Highest Electronegativity is **Fluorine** (Fl)

# Ionisation Energy

-   Energy required to remove an electron from a given atom
-   **First Ionisation Energy (of an element)**: Energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms

$$ M(g) \longrightarrow M^+(g) + e^- $$

-   Can use ionisation energy to find reactivity of metals
    -   When metals react, they lose electrons (ionisation energy)
    -   Group 1 only has first ionisation energy, as it only has 1 valence electron
-   ********************Increases across a period*********************
    -   Stronger ESF between nucleus and valence electrons due to smaller atomic radius
    -   Greater number of protons results in greater force of attraction between nucleus and valence electrons
        -   Shielding remains the same, proton number increases, nuclear charge increases
    -   Energy required to overcome this ESF increases, therefore ionisation energy increases
-   **Decreases down a period**
    -   Increasing atomic radius
    -   ESF between valence electron and nucleus is weaker
    -   Increase in shielding effect
        -   Increase in number of energy levels
    -   Decrease in net ESF between valence electron and nucleus
    -   Energy required to overcome ESF decreases, therefore ionisation energy decreases

# Polar and Non-Polar Covalent Bonds

-   Electrons in a covalent bond are not always shared equally
-   Therefore, it relies on the electronegativity of the elements involved
-   Covalent bond that has an **************unequal************** sharing of electrons is called a ********************polar covalent bond********************
-   Covalent bond that has an **********equal********** sharing of electrons is called a **********************************************non-polar covalent bond**********************************************
-   Example:

$$ ^{δ-}F-^{δ+}B $$

-   “δ±” is the dipole, so when it says “write a dipole across the polar bonds”, do this
- Bonds with the greatest permanent dipole will have the greatest difference in their electronegativity(s)
