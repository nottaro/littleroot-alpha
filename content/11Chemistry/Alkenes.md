- Unsaturated hydrocarbon
- Has a double bond
- General formula: $C_n H_{2n}$

### **Geometrical Structural Isomers**
- There is no rotation possible around a double bond
- 2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different
- Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond
- Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond
#### Criteria
- Double Bond between carbons (C=C)
- 2 different groups attached

## Chemical Properties
### Addition reactions
1. Hydrogenation (*$+H_2$)
	1. Saturation
	2. Alkene + $H_2$ $\rightarrow$ alkane
2. Halogenation ($+Cl_2 / Br_2/I_2$)
	1. Alkene + halogen $\rightarrow$ alkane with new functional group
	2. Test for alkene double bond
	3. $Br_{2(aq)}$ is bromine water, orange solution
		1. Colourless gas bubbled through orange solution, orange solution decolourises
3. Reaction with hydrogen halide (HCl, HBr, HI)
	1. Alkene + hydrogen halide $\rightarrow$ halo-alkane
4. Hydration ($+H_2O$)
	1. Alkene + water $\rightarrow$ some sort of alcohol
	2. BRAZILLLLLLLLL (pilling reference, you wouldn't get it)
