- Series of analytical techniques that can be used to separate mixtures of compounds for further use or for analysis
- In all forms of chromatography, a **mobile phase** moves through or across a **stationary phase**
- **Stationary phase**: This phase does not move. 
	- Compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (adsorbed) and slowed down.
	- Either a solid or a liquid
- **Mobile Phase**: This phase moves.
	- The more soluble compounds in the mixture are carried faster as the mobile phase moves. 
	- Either a liquid or a gas
- Paper chromatography
- Thin Layer chromatography
- Column chromatograph
- Gas chromatography
- High-performance liquid chromatography

## Paper Chromatography
- Used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments
- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture
- The solvent is drawn up the paper by capillary action
- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the unknown mixture
- The distance the solvent travels relies upon its polarity
- The more polar molecules will be more adsorbed to the paper, and thus will travel less

## Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)
- All chromatography involves a stationary phase and a mobile phase
- Stationary phase is a **layer of silica gel (polar)** fixed on a rigid glass plate
- The mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substances
- Uses same principles as paper chromatography
	- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix
	- However, while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mace, in TLC, separation often depends on solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix
	- A dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it
	- Some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others so they lag behind the solvent
		- The more polar molecules have a stronger IMF between itself and the gel, thus it sticks more strongly, and lags
	- Eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance
- The solvent (i.e. the mobile phase) is drawn up the stationary phase by capillary action
	- Adhesive forces are between molecules of different substances
		- Adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to stationary phase
	- Cohesive forces are between molecules of the same substance
		- Cohesion enables solvent molecules to bond to each other and move each other through stationary phase
	- Capillary action causes liquids to form a meniscus in a narrow glass tube.

## TLC or Paper Chromatography?
- TLC has a lot of advantages
	- Glass plate is rigid, not flexible like paper, so it is easy to control
	- After separation, the substances in the mixture can be recovered
		- The silica gel holding the separated substances is scraped of the glass plate and added to a solvent
		- The substance will dissolve and the silica gel can easily be removed by filtration
		- The glass plates can be re-coated with silica gel and be used over and over again

## Retention Factor (Rf)
- Ratio of the distance traveled of the solute to the solvent
- Different pigments have different Rf values
$$Rf=\frac{Solute_{distance}}{Solvent_{distance}}$$
- Greater Rf means it is more non-polar

## UV and Locating Agents
- Many substances are white or colourless, and so aren't visible on a TLC plate
- One way of making colourless substances show up is to use UV light.
- This usually works well for organic compounds
- An alternative method is to use a chemical locating agent – a chemical that reacts with the substance to form a coloured compound.
	- For example, when ninhydrin is exposed to an organic compound it stains it purple-brown.

## Gas Chromatography
- Used widely in many analytical laboratories, including forensic police labs, synthetic chemical labs, and drugs testing labs.
- Suitable for low molecular weight samples
- In paper and thin layer chromatography, the mobile phase is a liquid
- However, as the name implies, the mobile phase in GC is an inert gas. 
- The stationary phase is usually a long thin tube of silica gel.
- Like all forms of chromatography, GC uses a stationary phase to impede the movement of a mobile test substance.
- Different substances are attracted to the matrix by different amounts, and therefore journey along it at different speeds.
- In GC, the sample is injected into the machine, where it is vaporised. It is then washed over the matrix by an inert gas.
- Some substances will be more attracted to the matrix than others. These will take much longer to reach the detector.
	- Adhesion forces are stronger than cohesive forces
- The detector measures the abundance of a substance at a given time, and this data is plotted on a graph.

## High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
- High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a development of column chromatography in which the eluent is pumped through the column at high pressure.
	- Eluent: In chromatography, a solvent used in order to effect separation by elution.
- This results in better and faster separation than can be achieved in standard column chromatography.

| Constant temperature                                          | Increasing temperature                                        |
| Compounds partition from the mobile phase based on solubility | Compounds partition from the mobile phase based on volatility |
| Elution is generally time or volume dependent                | Elution is generally temperature dependent                                                              |

## Column Chromatography (Extension)
- Mobile phase is passed through (under pressure) the stationary phase
- Interaction between the MP and SP with the compounds in the mixture enable separation
