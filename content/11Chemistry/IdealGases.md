## Gas Laws
- Describe how gases behave
- Can be predicted by the kinetic theory
- Kinetic theory: all matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant motion
- Real Gases
	- Do have volume
	- Attraction between particles
	- Can condense or solidify
- Ideal Gases
	- No volume
	- No attraction between particles
	- Follows gas laws at all temperatures and pressures
- Real gases differ most from ideal gases at low temperatures and high pressures
- In order to completely describe a gas you need to measure 4 things
	1. Pressure
	2. Temperature
	3. Volume
	4. Number of particles

### Gas Pressure
- Pressure: force per unit area
- Gas particles exert pressure when they collide iwth the walls of their comntainer
- The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa)
- However, theyere are seveal units of pressure
	- Pascal ()
	- Kilpascal (kPa)
	- Atmosphere (atm)

### Temperature
- Average kinetic energy is directly proportionate to the Kelvin temperature
- At absolute 0 (0 degrees kelvin or -273.15 ˚ C), there is no molecular motion
- Standard temperature and presssure: 
	- 0˚ C or 273.15 K
	- Standard pressure: 1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 torr = 101.3 kPa
- Kelvin = 273.15 + ˚C
- ˚C = Kelvin - 273.15

## Ideal Gas Laws
- Given that the gas is ✨ideal✨
### Boyle's Law
- The pressure of a gas increases as its volume decreases, and vice versa
- $P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$
- tldr: pressure is inversely proportional to volume
- We are assuming:
	1. Constant mass
	2. Constant temperature

### Brownian Motion
- Gas particles move in an irregular, seemingly random path
- Example: smoke
	- When an air particle bombardes a smoke particle, the smoke particle moves to the original direction of the air particle
	- The air particle changes its direction to that of the smoke particle

### Charle's Law
- At a constant pressure, the volume of a gas increases as the temperature of the gas increases, and the volume decresese when the temperature ddecreases
- $\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}$
- Increases average kinetic energy
- Increases the speed of the particles
- The walls of a flexible container expand

### Gay-Lussac's Law
- The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature (Kelvin) at a constant volume
- $\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}$

## The Ideal Gas Equation
- One more gas law exists for changes in the gas properties as well as the amount of gas present in moles
- This law is referred to as the Ideal Gas Law because it accurately predicts gas properties of ideal gases
- Most gases at moderate conditions behaving like an ideal gas
$$PV = nRT$$
- P = pressure (kPa)
- V = volume (L)
- n = moles (mol)
- R = 8.314 (universal gas constant)
	- 0.08314 if using litres, atm, mole and kelvin temperature
- T = temperature (K)

### Avogardro's Law
- Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain eqaula number of molecules
- 1 mole of any gas takes up a volume of 22.71 L at STP
$$n=\frac{V}{22.71}$$
