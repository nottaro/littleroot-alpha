[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry)

- On average, water makes up approx. 55-78% of a person's body mass
	- Differs with sex, age, body weight, etc
- Essential for our body
	- E.g., transports nutrients, excretion of waste, sweating to cool down
- Most abundant compound on the Earth's surface
	- 97.3% is saline
		- 97.2% of this is in the ocean
	- 2.7% is fresh water
		- 68% of this is tied up in the polar ice caps and glaciers
	- 0.6% of this is available of fresh water in rivers, lakes, swamps or groundwater
		- Thus, only 1.62% of the world's water is available as an accessible source
- Most water is not suitable for consumption
	- Contains dissolved salts that would dehydrate us
	- Contains dissolved substances substances, e.g. organic compounds, heavy metals, which may be toxic to our organs or carcenogenic
- Freshwater supplies may not be potable
	- May contain suspended matter
		- E.g. clay particles, pathogens/micro-organisms that cause diseases like cholera or dysentery

## Potable Water

- Potable water: water that is safe to cook/drink
	- Should be:
		- Colourless
		- Odourless
		- Contain no pathogens or toxic substances
		- Pleasant to taste ~~(how? water doesn't have a taste)~~
- Total Dissolved Solids(TDS) should not exceed 600 mg per L, as per the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
- Depending on the source of water, there are different ways of treating it
- The traditional source of water in WA is freshwater from rivers and dams
	- Usually require only disinfection and fluoridation
- Due to increased demand and weather changes, groundwater is more significant, and recently, drinking water has even been taken from the Indian Ocean
- Water quality is essential due to its uses as drinking water, in agriculture and more 
	- This means we need to find ways to maintain the quality of water we access 
- We need to purify our water so it is considered potable which can be done using various methods 
- For this topic it is good to have an understanding of concentration

## Contamination
- Water is a very effective solvent
-  As a highly polar molecule, water is great at dissolving polar molecule substances and many ionic substances
- Water can form a range of intermolecular forces to stabilise a solution
	- Dipole-dipole forces with polar molecules
	- Hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bonding polar molecules
	- Ion-dipole forces with ions from ionic compounds
- This can be a problem as water can be easily contaminated 
- Both chemical and biological substances can contaminate water

> [!info] Chemical Contaminants
> 
> - Chemical contaminants are the elements or compounds that can cause harm if consumed
> - The main types of chemical contaminants are:
> 	- Heavy metals
> 	- Pollutants and fertiliser
> 	- Organic pollutants
