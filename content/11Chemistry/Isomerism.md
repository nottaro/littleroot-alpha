## **Structural Isomers**
-   Isomers: organic molecules with the same molecular formula but a different structural formula
-   Structural isomers have:
	-   Different names
	-   Different shapes
	-   Different chemical properties



## **Geometrical Structural Isomers**

-   There is no rotation possible around a double bond
-   2 molecules can form where the position of the double bond remains the same but the spatial arrangement across the double bond is different
-   Cis isomer: CH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond
-   Trans isomer: CH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond

## ### **Structural Isomerisms**
-   Different structural formulae
-   Chain isomerism
	-   Carbon chain is arranged differently, e.g. different shape, L shape instead of chain, cross shape
-   Positional isomerism
	-   Functional group is attached to a different carbon atom, e.g. 3-chloropentane, 2-chloropentane
	-   Also exists in alkenes with 4 or more carbon atoms
-   Functional group isomerism
	-   Have different functional groups, so are members of different homologous series

### **Stereoisomerism**
-   Have same structural formula
-   3d arrangement of atoms is different
-   2 types
-   Cis-trans isomerism
-   Optical isomerism

	### **Cis-trans isomerism**
	-   Molecules can rotate freely around C-C covalent bonds, but not around C=C double bonds
	-   Leads to cis-trans isomerism, in which isomers differ in the arrangement of the groups attached to the carbons in the double bonds
	-   These isomers cannot be super imposed on each other because the arrangement of the methyl groups is different
	-   If an alkyl group or atom other than hydrogen is attached to each carbon then the atoms can be named either **cis** (on the same side) or **trans** (on the opposite side)
	
	**Limitations of Cis-Trans isomerism**
	-   In more complex organic compounds, in which multiple hydrogens have been substituted by different groups, isomers cannot be defined using the **cis-trans** notation
	-   Instead, a different system is used for these type of molecules: **E-Z notation**

## **E-Z Notation**
-   Used to identify stereoisomers that cannot be called cis or trans
-   Isomers are identified as either E or Z depending on what “priority” is given to the groups attached to the carbon atoms in the double bond
-   Priority of these groups is determined by a series of complex rules
-   **E** represents the German word “entgegen”(opposite) and corresponds to trans isomers
-   The highest priority groups are on the opposite side of the double bond
-   **Z** represents the German word “zusammen”(together) and corresponds to cis isomers
-   The highest priority groups are on the same side of the double bond

## **Optical isomerism**
-   A molecule can exist as 2 isomers that are non-superimposable, mirror images of each other, just like a left hand and right hand
-   Optical isomers have the same physical properties but they rotate polarised light in opposite directions

## Boiling Point with Isomers
### **Van der Waal’s forces**
-   Named after Dutch scientist J D Van der Waal who discovered them
-   The forces are created by the constant movements of electrons in atoms of molecules at high speeds
-   At any instant in time there is the likelihood that one side of the molecule has a greater proportion of electrons
-   This is called a dipole, and causes the molecule to have positively and negatively charged ends
-   A temporary dipole or imbalance of charge can attract the electron cloud from a neighbouring atom or molecule, e.g. slightly positive end attracts negatively charged electrons
-   The temporary dipole induces an imbalance of charges in neighbouring molecules
-   The strength of the VdW force is dependent on the size of the molecules or atoms
-   As the size and molecular mass of the molecule increases so does the number of electrons, resulting in a greater imbalance of charge, and therefore a greater VdW attraction
-   This is why boiling points increase as the number of carbon atoms increase in alkanes, more energy is required to overcome the VdW forces

### Putting it all together
- Branched isomers have a smaller surface area
- They are more compact
- Thus, there is less area of contact between temporary/induced dipoles, and/or molecules
- Thus, dispersion force strength decreases
- Thus, boiling point decreases
