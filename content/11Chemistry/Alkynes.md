- 1 Sigma bond
- 2 Pi bonds
- Triple bond between 2 carbon atoms
- Unsaturated

##### Ethyne Addition Reaction
$C_2H_2 + Br_2 \rightarrow C_2H_2Br_4$


## Arenes (very misleading, as they don't react with bromine water)
- benzene $C_6H_6$
- methylbenzene $C_7H_8$

#### Substitution Reaction of benzene with pure bromine ($Br_{2(e)}$)

$C_6 H_6 + Br_2 \rightarrow C_6H_5Br+HBr$, with catalyst

Do not need this (according to pilling god)
