## Mixtures
- Homogenous mixtures
	-   2 or more particles are mixed together so well that you only see one thing
	-   Composition is uniform throughout
	-   Composition is spread evenly
- Pure Substance
	-   Only one kind of particle in it
- Heterogenous materials
	- Composition is not spread evenly
- Homogenous Materials
	- One set of properties
	- No physical separation between particles
	- Composition is spread evenly
- Solute: What is dissolved
- Solvent: What dissolves the solute

## Solutions
-   Solute is equally distributed in solventÂ 
-   Saturated solution
	- Concentration of solute is at a maximum
	- No more solute can dissolve
-   Supersaturated Solution
	- At a high temperature, solution appears saturated
	- At lower temperatures, solute will precipitate out
	- There is more solute in the solvent than can be dissolved
-   Unsaturated solution
	-   Concentration of solute is below maximum
	-   More of the solute can dissolve
