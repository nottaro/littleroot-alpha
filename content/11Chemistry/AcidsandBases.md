- Salt: Substance formed when hydrogen in an acid is substituted by a metal ion

- For a group 1 metal M: $M^+$

| Acid       | Salt       |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| $HCl$      | $MCl$      |
| $HNO_3$    | $MNO_3$    |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $MHSO_4$   |
| $H_2 SO_4$ | $M_2 SO_4$ |
|            |            |


- An acid is a proton donor
-  A base is a proton acceptor

### The Role of Water
- Acid-base reactions occur in aqueous solutions
- Water can accept or donate protons; it can act as an acid or a base
$$HCl+H_2 O \rightarrow Cl^- + H_3 O^+$$
$$H_2O + NH_3 \rightleftharpoons OH^- + NH_4 ^+$$
- $H_3O^+$ is the hydronium ion
- Acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions but the proton $H^+$ is never found on its own
- It is always bonded to water (dative bond) in an aqueous solution
- I.e. $H^+_{(aq)}$ exists as $H_3O^+_{(aq)}$

## Theories
### Humphrey Davy Acid-Base Theory
- Acids are substances that contain hydrogen
- Not all acids contain oxygen
- **Flaw:** Not all hydrogen-containing substances are acids

### Svante Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory
- Acids dissociate in water forming $H^+$ ions as one product
- Bases dissociate in water forming $OH^-$ ions as one product
- Neutralisation involves the reaction of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ (an acid and a base) forming a salt in water
- **Flaws**
	- Theories only apply to aqueous solutions
	- Some substances such as $NH_3$ are bases and do not contain $OH^-$
	- Relative strengths are not addressed
	- Amphoteric substances are not addressed

## Strong and Weak Acids
- Acids ionise in aqueous solutions, releasing protons
- Strong acids (hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric) completely ionise in an aqueous solution
$$HCl+H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + Cl^-$$
$$H_2 SO_4 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_3O^+ + SO_4^{2-}$$
$$HNO_3 + H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + NO_3^-$$
- A dilute solution of hydrochloric acid is a strong acid
- Weak acids (e.g. carboxylic acids) only partially ionise in aqueous solutions
$$CH_3COOH + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + H_3O^+$$
- About 4 in every 1000 ethanoic acid molecules are ionised in a dilute solution
- A concentrated ethanoic acid is a weak acid

| Strong    | Weak      |
| --------- | --------- |
| $HCl$     | $H_3PO_4$ |
| $HNO_3$   | $H_2CO_3$ |
| $H_2SO_4$ | $HF$      |
| $HBr$     | $HCl_3$   |
| $HI$      | $H_2CO_4$ |
| $HClO_4$  | $HSO_4^-$ |

## Strong and Weak Bases
- Bases dissociate in aqueous solutions
- Strong bases fully dissociate in aqueous solutions
$$NaOH_{(aq)} \rightarrow Na^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)} $$
- A dilute solution of sodium hydroxide is a strong base

| Strong     | Weak        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| $NaOH$     | $NH_4OH$    |
| $KOH$      | $CO_3^{2-}$ |
| $Ba(OH)_2$ | $NH_3$      |
| $Sr(OH)_2$ | $F^-$       |
| $Ca(OH)_2$ | $CH_3COO^-$ |

## Electrolytes
- Electrolytes are substances that dissolve in water and form ions
- Strong electrolytes are good conductors of electricity in an aqueous solution because water causes them to dissociate (ionic compounds) or completely ionise (covalent molecules)


## Reactions of Acids with Metals
$$Metal+Acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2$$
$$Metal\ oxide + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt_{(maybe)} + H_2O_{(l)}$$
$$Metal\ hydroxide + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2O_{(l)}$$
$$Metal \ carbonate + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt + H_2O_{(l)}+CO_2{(g)}$$
$$Metal\ hydrogencarbonate + acid_{(aq)} \rightarrow salt +$$


- Metal oxides are always solid, unless specified otherwise


## Acids
- Substances that:
	- Have a pH below 7 and turn universal indicator yellow, orange, or red
	- Turn litmus red
	- Form solutions containing hydrogen ions ($H^+$)
- Hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) is a strong acid
- Ethanoic acid/vinegar ($CH_3 COOH$) is a weak acid
- Acids can be defined as substances that ionise to release $H^+$ ions when they dissolve in water
- Since acids release $H^+$ ions (protons), we call them $H^+$/proton donors

### What are $H^+$ ions?
- Hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron
- A $H^+$ ion is a hydrogen atom that has lost its single electron. This leaves a lone, positively charged proton
- Because acids donate protons, they are sometimes called proton donors.
- When dissolved in water, the $H^+$ ion is hydrated. 
- This is represented in formulae by adding a state symbol, $H^+_{(aq)}$. 
- This is shorthand for the hydronium ion, $H_3O^+ _{(aq)}$

## Alkalis/Bases
- Substances that:
	- Have a pH above 7 and turn universal indicator blue or purple
	- Turn litmus blue
	- Can neutralise acids
	-  Form solutions containing hydroxide ions ($OH^-$)
	- Sodium hydroxide is a strong alkali.
	- Ammonia is a weak alkali
		- When ammonia is dissolved in water, it forms ammonium hydroxide, ($NH_4OH$), a fertiliser.
- Bases are substances that react with acids.
- They absorb hydrogen ions ($H^+$). Bases are therefore $H^+$ acceptors, or proton acceptors.
- The oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of metals, such as sodium carbonate, are bases.
- Some bases are soluble in water: these bases are called alkalis.
- Alkalis release hydroxide ions ($OH^–$) in solution.
- All alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis.


## What is pH?
- The acidity of an aqueous solutoin depends on the number of $H^+ \ (H_3O^+)$ ions in solution
- The pH is defined as: $-log_{10}[H^+]$ 
	- Where $[H^+]$ is the concentration of $H^+$ in $mol \ L^-$ 
- The pH scale is a logarithmic scale with base 10
- This means that each value is 10 times the value below it
	- E.g., pH 5 is 10 times more than pH 6
- pH values are usually given to 2 decimal places
- The pH of an acid depends on both its strength and concentration
- A strong acid has a low pH (usually 0 or 1)
	- This means that the concentration of $H^+$ is high, as the acid is fully dissociated into its ions
- A weak acid has a higher pH (but still less than 7)
	- This means that the concentration of $H^+$ is lower than for a strong acid, as the acid is not fully dissociated into its ions

### Concentrated vs Diluted
- Strong and concentrated do not mean the same thing.
- Strong – high proportion of substance forms ions in solution.
- Weak – low proportion of substance forms ions in solution.
- Concentrated – lots of solute per volume of solution.
- Dilute – less solute per volume of solution.
