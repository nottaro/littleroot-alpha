-   Electrostatic forces of attraction between cations of metal and a sea of delocalised electrons
-   Metal atoms are packed together in a giant metallic lattice
-   Outer electrons are delocalised
**-   All metals can conduct electricity with varying results**
    -   The sea of delocalised electrons can move freely
    -   Therefore, they can move and conduct charge, as they are negatively charged
-   **High boiling/melting point**
    -   Increases with the electrostatic force of attraction between electrons and the nucleus
        -   More delocalised electrons
        -   Higher charge on cation
        -   Stronger metallic bond
-   **Ductile:** Able to be drawn out/stretched into a wire
    -   Cations are in a sea of delocalised electrons
    -   Therefore, they will slide when a force is applied, without breaking
-   **Malleable:** Can be beaten into sheets without being broken
    -   Cations are in a sea of delocalised electrons
    -   Therefore, they will slide when a force is applied, without breaking
      
- Giant metallic lattice structure (Na, Mg, Al)
    -   Always describe metals as “grey solids”, with a few exceptions
        -   Gold is “yellow”
        -   Copper is “salmon-pink”
        -   There is no metal that is white
