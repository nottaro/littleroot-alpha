-   Electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged(cations and anions) ions in a network
    
-   Consists of a metal and a non-metal combined together
    
-   Examples
    
    -   $NaCl$
        -   Sodium loses an electron and becomes a cation, with the stability of a noble gas
            -   $Na = 2,8,1\rightarrow Na^+=2,8+\overline{e}$
        -   Chloride gains an electron, and becomes an anion, with the stability of a noble gas
            -   $Cl=2,8,7\rightarrow Cl^+=2,8,8+\overline{e}$
    -   $MgCl_2$
        -   Magnesium loses 2 electrons and becomes a cation, with the stability of a noble gas
            -   $Mg = 2,8,2\rightarrow Mg^{2+}=2,8+2\overline{e}$
        -   Chloride gains an electron, and becomes an anion, with the stability of a noble gas
            -   $Cl=2,8,7\rightarrow Cl^+=2,8,8+\overline{e}$
            -   $Cl=2,8,7\rightarrow Cl^+=2,8,8+\overline{e}$
        -   Therefore, 2 chlorine ions bond with 1 magnesium ion
    -   $MgO$
    -   $CaCO_3$
-   Ions exist in a 3D, ionic lattice
    
-   **Cannot conduct electricity as a solid**
    
    -   Ions are in a fixed lattice
    -   Therefore, the ions/electrons are fixed and cannot move
    -   Charge cannot be conducted
-   **Conducts electricity when liquid/molten/dissolved**
    
    -   The ions do not exist in a lattice
    -   Therefore, they are free/mobile
    -   Charge can be conducted
-   ********************************High melting and boiling points********************************
    
    -   Ions are in a fixed lattice
    -   Ionic bonds are strong
    -   Therefore, the energy required to break up the lattice is large
-   ********************Brittle********************
    
    -   Ions exist in a lattice
    -   When a force is applied, layers of the lattice are displaced
    -   Therefore, ions with like charges come close to each other, and repel each other
    -   The lattice shatters, and is therefore brittle
-   ****Often soluble in water****
    
    -   Depends on ESF of the lattice
    -   If the intermolecular forces of the $H_2O$ molecule is greater than the lattice, the lattice is displaced and it dissolves
    -   If the latticeâ€™s ESF is greater than the intermolecular forces of the $H_2O$ molecule, it is not displaced and is therefore not soluble
-   Lewis Diagrams are known as **dot-dot** or **dot-cross**
