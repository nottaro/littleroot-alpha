**Orbitals**: Area of space that is likely to contain electrons

**Cathode Ray Tube**: A high vacuum tube in which **cathode rays** produce luminous images on a fluorescent screen

**Cathode Rays**: Another name for travelling electrons **Cathode**: Where electricity flows out. Usually the **negative sideAnode**: Where electricity flows into. Usually the **positive side**

**Alpha particle**: A particle with 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Positively charged, i.e., 2+. Identical to a Helium-4 nucleus.

**Line Emission Spectra/Atomic Emission Spectra**: The specific range of EMR with discrete frequencies and energies that appears as single lines in an otherwise blank spectrum. This is unique for each element and is produced when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level

**Atomic Absorption Spectra**: The spectrum of EMR with specific frequencies that are absorbed by atoms and thus do not appear on the continuous spectrum

**Flame Test**: Qualitative analytical technique used to detect elements (primary metal ions) by observing their unique emission spectra

**Molecule**: group of atoms bonded together covalently

**Compound**: Substance made of atoms of different elements bonded together 

**Atom**: Smallest unit of matter that cannot be chemically divided

**Element**: Substance that cannot be decomposed further by a chemical reaction. All of its atoms have the same number of protons.

**Compound**: Substance made of atoms of different elements bonded together chemically

**Atom**: Smallest particle of an element that can exist on its own. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons

**Isotope**: Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different amount of neutrons

**Molecule**: Particle containing 2 or more atoms joined together by **covalent bonds**

**Ion**: An atom or group of atoms that has been **positively** or **negatively charged** by **losing** or **gaining electrons**, respectfully

**Elemental Ions**: Ions that are elements

**Molecular Ions**: Covalently bonded ions

**Chemical Symbol**: Abbreviation (i.e., letter or **pair** of letters) used to represent an element

**Relative Atomic Mass**: Mean mass of the atoms of an element **relative** to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom

**Chemical Formulae**: Molecular formula that gives the actual number of atoms of each element present in one particle

**Chemical Equation**: A balanced chemical equation shows the reactants taking part in a chemical reaction and the products formed from the reactants in the correct proportions

**Empirical Formula**: Chemical formula showing the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound using subscripts following chemical symbols

**Stoichiometry**: Relationship between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction

**Temperature**: A measure of the average kinetic energy in a substance
