- Concentration refers to the amount of solute dissolve in the solvent.
- We can use many kinds of units to describe how much solute we have in a solvent.

## Quantifying Concentration
- Concentration can be given in a range of different units:
- Mass per 100g water (% w/w)  
- Volume per 100 mL water (% v/v)  
- Mass per 100mL water (%w/v)  
- Parts per million (ppm) – mg per kg  
- Moles per litre of solution (mol $L^{-1}$)  
	- This is sometimes called molarity.


## Calculations

### v/v % (when solute is a liquid)
$$\frac{V_{solute}}{V_{solvent}}\times100\%$$

- mL per 100 mL, or mL/100mL


### m/v % (when solute is a solid)
$$\frac{m_{solute}}{V_{solvent}}\times100\%$$
- g per 100 mL, or g/100mL

### m/m % (when both solute and solvents are solids)

$$\frac{m_{solute}}{m_{solvent}}\times100\%$$
- g per 100 g, or g/100g


### Density
- Sometimes we have to convert volume of solution into mass of solution. Use value of density if such provided to do the calculations.
- $Mass=Density \times Volume$
- $Density = \frac{Mass}{Volume}$ 

### Parts per Million
- As a ratio:  parts per million (ppm)
- $$Ppm = \frac{mass_{solute}}{mass_{solvent}}$$
- Mass of solute is in mg, mass of solvent in kg
  

### Molarity
- mol/Litre, a.k.a. $mol\ L^{-1}$ 
- Also known as molarity, M

$$C=\frac{n}{V}$$
- V is in Litres

### Grams Per Litre
- g/litre
$$\frac{m}{V}$$
- V is in Litres, m is in grams
