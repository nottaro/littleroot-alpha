-   Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells
    
-   **n** is the principal quantum number or shell number
    
-   The maximum number of electrons in each shell is:
    
    $2n^2$
    
-   Shells are divided into sub shells
    
    -   S: Holds maximum of 2 electrons
    -   P: Holds maximum of 6 electrons
    -   D: Holds maximum of 10 electrons
    -   F: Holds maximum of 14 electrons

| **Principle Quantum Shell** | **Sub-shells** | Total Number of Electrons |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| n=1                         | 1s             | 2                         |
| n=2                         | 2s, 2p         | 8                         |
| n=3                         | 3s, 3p, 3d     | 18                        |
| n=4                         | 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f | 32                          |

********************Order of filling of sub-shells********************

-   Rule for fulling sub-shells with electrons is to start with the **lowest energy available** sub-shell
-   The sub-shells can be seen below in ****************************************************increasing order of energy****************************************************

$$ 1s^2,2s^2,2p^6,3s^2,3p^6,4s^2,3d^{10},4p^6,5s^2,4d^{10},5p^6,4f^{14},6s^2... $$

-   Orbital: region around the nucleus of an atom that can hold up to 2 electrons with opposite spins
    -   Area of space which has a high probability of an electron existing in that area. Up to 2 electrons can exist there, each with an opposite spin

| Sub-shell | Shape           |
| --------- | --------------- |
| S         | Sphere          |
| P         | Infinity Symbol |

-   Each orbital holds up to 2 electrons regardless of whether it is an “s”, a “p” or a “d” orbital
-   Electrons have **************************opposite spin************************** to prevent repulsion
-   The number of occupied energy shells is equal to the **period number**
-   Outermost electron in “x” sub-shell is part of the “x” block, x being an unknown variable
