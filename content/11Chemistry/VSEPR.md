- VSEPR model can predict the structure of most molecules and polyatomic ions in which the central atom is a non-metal
- Also works for some structures in which the central atom is a metal
- VSEPR builds on Lewis Electron Dot Structures
- Lewis structures alone predict only connectivity while the Lewis structure and VSEPR together can predict the geometry of each atom in a molecule

### Key Concepts
1. The 4 pairs of electrons around a central atom repel each other
2. Pairs of electrons arrange themselves so they are as far apart as possible
3. The repulsion between lone pairs is greater than the repulsion between bonding
