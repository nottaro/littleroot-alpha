- **Atom**: Smallest unit of matter that cannot be chemically divided
- **Element**: Substance that cannot be decomposed further by a chemical reaction. All of its atoms have the same number of protons.
- **Compound**: Substance made of atoms of different elements bonded together chemically
- **Molecule**: group of atoms bonded together covalently

## Pure Substances
- Fixed or constant composition
- Cannot be separated by physical means
- Have well defined physical properties
	- Melting point
	- Boiling point
	- Hardness
	- Density
	- Colour
- Have constant chemical properties

## Mixture
- Contain 2 or more different substances, in proportions that can vary
- Properties vary with composition, depends on the identity and amount of constituents
- Properties of individual constituents can be used to separate the mixture

## Homogenous Materials
- Have uniform composition throughout
- includes all pure substances (elements and compounds) and some mixtures
- The only kind of mixture that is homogenous is a solution, e.g. salt water
- Alloys

## Heterogenous Materials
- Non-uniform; you can see differences from one section to another
- The constituents are physically separated
	- E.g. in a different phase
- Examples:
	- Granite (mixture of different mineral grains)
	- Milk (fat globules suspended in water)
	- Toothpaste (solid particles suspended in liquid)
