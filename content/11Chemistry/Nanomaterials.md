Most of these are mine, but I have ~~stolen~~ adapted some of Ajay's notes. I'm not gonna tell you, you can guess.

- 1 nanometer (nm) is equal to $1 \times 10^{-9}$ meters
- **Nanotechnology**: study of how to produce and control very small structures, i.e. in the nano-scale
	- The nanoscale is anything between the size of 1 to 100 nano-metres

## Nanoparticles

- Nanoparticles are particles of matter in the size of the nanoscale
- At least one dimension within the nanoscale
- Nanoparticles have different chemical and physical properties to their bulk counterparts due to the massive surface area to volume ratio
- E.g. gold is red as a nanoparticle

### Manufacturing Nano-particles
- Nanoparticles are manufactured either from top down or bottom up:
- Top down is where larger particles are broken down into nanoparticles
- Bottom up is where single atoms and molecules are assembled into larger nano-structures

### Quantum Dots
- Nanoparticles of dimension 2-10 nm made from compounds
- Bulk material is white, and visible while protecting from ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
- Absorbs all incident UV, but reflects all colours in the visible spectrum, therefore appears as white
- Smaller, therefore exhibits quantum properties
	- It is smaller than the wavelength of light thus light passes through it, and it does not reflect light - thus it is transparent
- However it still has UV deflecting capability due to quantum effects
- **Sunscreen**
	- Made from compounds such as $TiO_2$ and $ZnO$
	- Quantum dots absorb all incident UVR due to quantum effects
	- Keeps us safe from UVR from sun
	- Appears white as it reflects all colours in the visible spectrum

### Carbon Nanotubes (CNT)
- Covalent structure of formation $C_x$
- Cylindrical molecule consisting of rolled-up sheets of single-layer carbon atoms (graphene)
- Can be simple or multi-walled
- Tubular
- Mechanical tensile strength of up to 400 times that of steel
- Light-weight: density is $\frac{1}{6}$ of steel
- Good at conducting heat
- Hollow
- Resistant to corrosion
- Chemically stable
- Less than 100 nm in diameter
	- Can have a diameter of 1-2 nm

### CNT Computers
- Carbon nanotubes are electrically conductive
- Stronger signals can be sent using far smaller transistors(semi-conductors) than is possible with silicon.
- CNT computers use about a tenth as much power as comparable silicon systems
- More sustainable

### Silver Nano-particles
- Nano-particles composed of silver
- 1 - 100 nm
- High conductivity, 
- Powerful signal capacity
- Biocompatibility
- Anti-bacterial properties
	- Also effective against various fungi, viruses, and algae

### Nano-composites
- Nano-particles made of 2 or more different types of mater with significantly different properties
- Final nano-material has properties different(or sometimes a combination) to the individual components of the composite
- They are unique, as they exhibit properties that are different to (or sometimes a combination of) the individual components - they develop these due to quantum effects
- For a composite to be considered a nano-composite, at least 1 composite must be nano-scaled

### Dendrimers:
-   Nano-sized, radially symmetrical molecules
-   Good materials for the development of nanotechnologies because of their well-defined structure and properties

## Imaging Nanoparticles:
- Electron is aimed and fired at a surface, and rebounds back to a sensor 
- Time is calculated, and thus distance, as we know the velocity

### TEM - Transmission Electron Microscopy
-   Uses an electron beam to image a nanoparticle sample using transmitted electrons
-   TEM can reveal details at the atomic scale by magnifying nanometre structures up to 50 million times
-   Doesn't rely on light in the visible spectrum; produces higher resolution than light based imaging
-   Most desired method for imaging

### SEM - Scanning Electron Microscopy
-   Uses electron beams to magnify infinitesimal features
-   Electrons are deflected off object and then detected

### STEM - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
-   Atomic scale resolution, better than SEM
-   Can cause sample damage

### AFM - Atomic-force Microscopy
-   3D characterisation of nanoparticles with sub-nanometre resolution
-   Can directly create images of nanoparticles with dimensions between 0.5 to 50+ nano-metres


## Safety of Nanoparticles:
-   Nanoparticles can easily penetrate cell membranes and tissue
	-   They could cause biochemical damage or even cancer
	-   They can interact with biological systems
-   There are many potential dangers as nanoparticles can be highly reactive or catalytic due to their large surface area to volume ratio
-   People need to be careful when dealing with nanoparticles
	-   They must wear correct equipment e.g. gloves
-   The long term effects of nanoparticles in sunscreens is currently unknown
