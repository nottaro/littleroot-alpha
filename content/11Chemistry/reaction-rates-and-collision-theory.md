[go back](11Subjects/11Chemistry.md)

- The speed at which a reaction happens
$$Rate=\frac{\Delta[Reactants]}{\Delta t}\ mol L^{-1}s^{-1}$$
- \[Reactants] is concentration
- For a reaction to happen, particles must collide
- The reaction is complete ~~when sin(Î¸)=1, where $\theta$ is equal to the angle between the perpendicular line to the curve~~ when the volume of gas produced does not change further

### What affects rate of reaction
1. Catalysts
2. Temperature
3. Pressure
4. Concentration
5. Surface area

## Collision Theory
- Reactions take place when particles collide with a certain amount of energy
- The minimum amount of energy needed for the particles to react is called the **activation energy** and is different for each reaction
- The  rate of a reaction depends on 2 things:
	- The frequency of collisions between particles
	- The energy with which particles collide
- If particles collide with less energy than the activation energy, they will not react
- The particles will just bounce off each other

### Changing the rate of reaction
- Anything that increases the number of successful collisions between reactant particles will speed up a reaction
- What factors affect the rate of reactions?
	- Increased temperature
	- Increased concentration  of dissolved reactants, and increased pressure of gaseous reactants
	- increased surface area of solid reactants
	- Use of a catalyst

### Slower and slower!
- Reactions do not proceed at a steady rate
- They start off at a certain speed, then get slower and slower until they stop
- As the reaction progresses, the concentration of reactants decreases
- This reduces the frequency of collisions between particles and so the reaction slows down

### How can rate of reaction be measured?
- Measuring the rate of reaction means measuring the change in the amount of a reactant or the amount of a product

### Effect of Temperature on Rate of reaction
- The effect of increasing temperature on the rate of reaction
	- Increased average **kinetic energy** of particles
	- Increased **velocity/speed** of particles
	- Increased frequency of collisions
	- increased proportion of collisions with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome activation energy
	- Increased frequency of successful collisions
	- Increased rate of reaction
