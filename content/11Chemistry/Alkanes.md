## Hydrocarbons
- Organic Molecule: any molecule that contains carbon
- Hydrocarbon: molecule containing only hydrogen and carbon
- Saturated Hydrocarbon: hydrocarbon where there exist only single bonds between carbon atoms

## Alkanes
- Hydrocarbon with all single bonds
- Thus, it is a saturated hydrocarbon
- $C_n H_{2n+2}$

### Chemical Properties of Alkanes
- Not reactive
- However, it will react with certain substances in certain conditions
- Substitution reactions
	- Halogenation (reaction with halogen)
		- $CH_4+Cl_2\rightarrow CH_3Cl + HCl$
			- Not Hydrochloric acid
			- **Hydrogen Chloride**
	- Requires UV light to break C-H bond
#### Combustion
- Fuel burns in oxygen
- Exothermic reaction
- Complete combustion: there is an excess of $O_2$
	- $O_2 + x \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O+energy$
- Incomplete combustion: there is a limited supply of $O_2$
	- $O_2+x \rightarrow CO+H_2O+energy$
	- $O_2+x \rightarrow C+H_2O+energy$
