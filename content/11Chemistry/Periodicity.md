Honestly, I'm not even sure what this is about.
- Update 13/4/2023: I have been told that it's basically the same as periodic trends
- Update 15/4/2023: I have no idea what this is for

## Physical Properties
- Boiling point
- Melting point
- Hardness
- Conductivity
- Brittle
- Malleable
- Ductile

## Allotropes of Carbon
- Carbon has 4 valence electrons
- Can bond to itself, and forms a variety of different compounds
- Diamond
	- Non-conductive of electricity
	- High melting/boiling point
- Graphite
	- 2D hexagonal layers
	- Mobile delocalised electrons that are free to move within layers
	- Dispersion forces between layers
	- Conductive of electricity
- Buckyball - (Buckminster fulleren z )
	- Not conductive of electricity
	- Used as a dry lubricant
