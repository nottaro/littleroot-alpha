## Enthalpy change
- $\Delta H$ = change in enthalpy, in $kJ\ mol^{-1}$
	- Change in heat energy
- **System**: reactants and products
	- Reactants and products both have enthalpy
	- Stored in bonds
	- Reactant (bonds break, energy required) $\rightarrow$ Products (bonds form, energy is given out)
- **Surroundings:** Everything that is not in the systme
- System transfers energy/heat/enthalpy to and from surroundings
- **Energy cannot be created nor destroyed**
- **Activation energy:** minimal amount of energy required for reaction to occur

## Exothermic and endothermic reactions

### Exothermic Reactions
- Exothermic reactions release energy, i.e. they release heat
	- Ex = out
	- thermic: relating to heat
- Enthalpy of system decreases
- Enthalpy of surroundings increases
- Can occur spontaneously, some are explosive
1. Combustion
2. Respiration
3. Neutralisation of acids with alkalis
4. Reactions of metals with alkalies
5. Displacement reactions of metals

### Endothermic Reactions
- Endothermic reactions absorb energy, i.e. they become cold
	- en = in 
- Enthalpy of system increases
- Enthalpy of surroundings decreases


## Catalyst

> [!example]+ Analogy
> 
> There are 2 villages, named Reactants and Products. In between is a mountain called "Activation Energy". To travel over the mountain is very difficult. However. We could do it another way. We could **dig** a tunnel in the mountain, to get to each village faster. This is basically what a catalyst does.

- Catalysts provide alternative pathways that use less activation energy
- They are not consumed in the reaction 

## Internal Energy
- The molecules within a body all possess kinetic energy ($E_k$)
	- This is the energy due to their random motion
- The molecules also contain potential energy($E_p$), due to chemical bonds holding them together and the bonds within their nuclei
- The sum of all these molecular kinetic and potential energies represents the body's internal energy (U)
$$U = E_k + E_p$$
### Temperature and Heat
- The temperature of a body is a measure of the kinetic energy of its molecules
	- Temperature indicates in which direction heat will flow when 2 bodies are placed close together
- Thermal energy is the component of a body's internal energy due to its temperature
	- Thermal energy can be supplied to a body by heating it
- Heat is the thermal energy transferred from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature, due solely to the temperature difference.
	- Measured in Joules, **not** ˚C or K
- Once bodies are at the same temperature, there is no net flow of thermal energy; the bodies are in thermal equilibrium


## Enthalpy (once again!)
- Enthalpy (H) is a measure of the energy stored in (or heat content of) a system
- Cannot be measured directly
	- We can calculate enthalpy change instead
- Always quoted at constant pressure
- During reactions, the enthalpy of the reactants and the products is not the same
- This results in energy being either given out or taken in during the reaction
- This energy is the enthalpy change, $\Delta H$
$$\Delta H =mc \Delta T$$
- c = specific heat capacity (usually of water, unless told otherwise)
	- Specific heat capacity: amount of energy to raise the temperature of 1 g of a substance by 1 ˚C
	- Water: $4.18\  J g^{-1} C^{-1}$
- m = mass (grams)
- $\Delta T$ = change in temperature (kelvin)
