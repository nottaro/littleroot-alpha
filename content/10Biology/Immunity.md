## **Innate Immunity**
- Based on genetic make-up
- Relies on already formed components
- Rapid response: within minutes of infection
- Not specific
	- Same molecules/cells respond to a range of pathogens
- Has no memory
	- Same response after repeated exposure
- Does not lead to clonal expansion
	- Clonal expansion: explosive increase in number of lymphocytes
### **Mechanisms**
- Mechanical barriers/surface secretion
	- Skin
	- Acidic pH in stomach
	- Cilia
- Humoral mechanisms (mediated by macromolecules, e.g. cells)
	- Lysosomes, basic proteins, complement, interferons 
- Cellular defence mechanisms
	- Natural killer cells
	- Neutrophils
	- Macrophages
	- Mast cells
	- Basophils 
	- Eosinophils


## **Adaptive Immunity**
- Based on resistance acquired during life
- Relies on genetic events and cellular growth
- Responds more slowly, over a few days
- Is more specific
	- Each cell responds to a single epitope on an antigen
- Has anamnestic memory
	- Repeated exposure leads to faster, stronger, response
- Leads to clonal expansion

### **Mechanisms**
- Cell-mediated immune response (CMIR)
	- T-lymphocytes
	- Eliminate intracellular microbes that survive within phagocytes or other infected cells
	- Doesn’t use antibodies
- Humoural Immune Reponse (HIR)
	- B-lymphocytes
	- - Mediated by antibodies
	- Eliminate extra-cellular microbes and their toxins

#### Cell-mediated immune response
1. T-Cell
	- Recognises peptide antigen on macrophage in association with major histo-compatibility complex (MHS) class
	- Identifies molecules on cell surface
	- Helps body distinguish self from non-self
2. T-cell goes into effectors cell stage that is able to kill infected cells
	- Activation of phagocytes, t-lymphocytes and cytokines in response to an antigen
	- Doesn’t involve antibodies

#### **Humoral Immune Response**

1. B lymphocytes recognise specific antigens
	- Proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells
2. Antigens bind to specific antigens on microbes: destroy microbes via specific mechanisms
3. Some B lymphocytes evolve into the resting state: memory cells
	- Mediated by macromolecules, e.g. antibodies, located in extracellular fluids
	- Uses antibodies
