# Microorganisms that cause Disease

## Bacteria
-  Majority of bacteria are non-pathogenic (harmless to humans)
- Some are pathogenic (cause disease)
- Essential to life on Earth
	- Decomposition of organic material and cycling of elements
- In/on the human body, bacteria colonise the gut, mouth, skin, genitals and airways
- Single-celled microscopic (0.1 - 5.0 μm) organisms
- Visible under light microscope
### Prokaryotic
- No membrane-bound organelles
- No nucleus
- DNA
- Single circular molecule: bacterial chromosome
- Bacterial cell envelope
- Capsule
- Cell wall
	- Generally comprised of peptidoglycan
		- Sugars and amino acids
- Cell membrane
	- Similar to that of other cells

### Types of Bacteria
- Bacteria are classified into groups based on their basic shapes
- Spherical shape: coccus
- Rod shaped: bacillus
- Curved:
	- Spiral: spirilla
	- Comma: vibrio
#### Cocci - NOTE: NOT NEEDED
- Spherical cells
- Can occur
	- Singly
	- In pairs (diplococci)
	- In clusters (staphylococci)
	- In chains (streptococci)

#### Bacilli - NOTE: NOT NEEDED
- Rod-shaped cells
- Have flagella for movement
- Can occur
	- Singly (bacillus)
	- In chains (streptobacillus)
	- Oval (coccobacillus)

#### Curved - NOTE: NOT NEEDED
- Spirilla
	- Thick, rigid spiral
- Vibrio
	- Curved or comma shaped rod
- Spirochaetes
	- Thin, flexible spiral
	- Corkscrew
### Cholera
- Vibrio cholera
- Lives in water and human hosts
- Halophilic: salt loving
- Highly motile(not a typo, i thought it was though ;-; ): moves very well using flagella (tail-like structure)
- Causes acute diarrhoeal infection when ingested through contaminated food or water

### Bacteria DNA Fishing

- Bacteria use pili to harness DNA from dead bacteria to incorporate into their own DNA
	- Horizontal gene transfer
- Evolutionary advantage such as obtaining antibiotic resistance

## Viruses
- Individual virus is called a virion
- Sub-microscopic particle (20-300 nm)
- Visible under electron microscope
- Non-cellular
- Doesn’t have cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes and other cell organelles
- Unable to make proteins or even replicate on their own 
- Instead they must depend on a host cell to synthesis their proteins and replicate
- Can contain either DNA or RNA
- **A virion consists of**
	- Nucleic acid core (RNA or DNA) surrounded by a protective protein coat (Capsid)
	- Sometimes they have a lipid envelope covering the protein capsid (enveloped virus)

### Types of virus
- RNA virus
	- Usually single stranded
	- Can be double stranded
- DNA virus
	- Usually double stranded
	- Can be single stranded

### Virus Replication
- As viruses are non-cellular, they don’t reproduce on their own like living organisms, instead they infect a host cell to replicate (make multiple copies of themselves)
- They infect a wide variety of organisms, including eukaryotes and prokaryotes
- Once inside the host cell, they use the cell’s ATP(Adenosine Triphosphate), ribosomes, enzymes and other cellular parts to replicate


## Fungi
- Most are multicellular
	- Yeast: uni-cellular fungi
- Heterotrophs
- Cell walls made of chitin (fibrous substance consisting of polysaccharides)
- Cell membrane has phospholipid bilayer
- Eukaryotic
	- Membrane-bound organelles with DNA
	- Membrane-bound organelles
- Microscopic to macroscopic
- Reproduce by forming spores
- Fungal disease: pneumocystis pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii

## Protist
- Large diverse group of microorganisms that aren’t plants, animals or fungi
- Between 60000-200000 different species
- Microscopic to macroscopic
	- 10 µm (unicellular protists) to several meters or more (multicellular seaweeds)
- Unicellular, multicellular or colonial
- Eukaryotic with nuclear membranes and membrane-bound organelles
- Most protists are aquatic organisms
- Nucleus with DNA
- Animal-like protists: Protozoa
	- Single-celled eukaryotes unlike animals that are multi-cellular
	- Like animals, they can move, and are heterotrophs
	- Size: 0.01-0.5 mm
	- Animal-like protists include the flagellates, ciliates, amoeba and apicomplexa

| Type of Protazoa                      | Movement                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Flagellates                           | Long flagela/tails that rotate in a propeller-like fashion                                                                                                                     | Trypanosoma: African sleeping sickness      |
| Pseudopodia (temporary feet.) Amoebae | Extends projections of cytoplasm out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward                                                                                 | Naegleria fowleri, deadly brain infections  |
| Ciliates                              | Cillia = tiny tail-like projections that extend outward from the cell body and beat back and forth                                                                             | Paramecium                                  |
| Apicomplexa                           | They don’t move, are intracellular parasites. They use special enzymes to penetrate the host’s tissues. Complex life cycle involving transmission between several host species | Plasmodium: spread by mosquitoes as malaria |

- Plant-like protists
	- Algae are plant-like protists
	- Large and diverse group
	- Autotrophs
	- Don’t have true stems, roots or leaves unlike plants
	- Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds and lakes
	- Can be uni-cellular or multi-cellular
	- Plants are multi-cellular
	- Example: Kelp and seaweed
- Fungi-like protists
	- Share many characteristics with fungi
	- Heterotrophs
	- Reproduce by forming spores
	- Differ from fungi as their cell walls are made of cellulose, fungi’s cell walls are made of chitin
	- 2 major types of fungus-like protists
		- Slime moulds
			- Grow as slimy masses on decaying matter
			- Commonly found on items such as rotting logs
		- Water moulds
			- Live in moist soil and surface water
			- Exist as parasites or feed on decaying organisms
